In particular, it does not create a fiduciary\\nrelationship where one would not otherwise exist nor require a _firm_ to\\nprovide advice or carry out any other _regulated activity_ where it would not\\notherwise have done so.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.12 G The _FCA_ has issued guidance on the Consumer Duty in FG22/5, which\\n_firms_ should read alongside _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A as a guide to the\\n_FCA’s_ view as to how _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A might be complied with.\\n\\n\\nGuidance on responsibilities of firms in a product’s distribution chain\\n\\n\\n2A.1.13 G (1) _Principle_ 12 imposes obligations on _firms_ towards _retail customers_ of\\n_products_ irrespective of whether the customer is a _client_ of the _firm_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) This extended application aims to ensure the effectiveness of\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 which may properly relate to activities\\nwhich determine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes\\ncarried out by a _firm_ with whom the _retail customer_ is not in a _client_\\nrelationship.\\n\\n\\n(3) A _firm’s_ role in the distribution chain may mean it is unable to\\ndetermine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes in\\nconnection with the _product_ . If so, the _firm_ may not be subject to any\\nobligation under _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.14 G Obligations on _firms_ in the distribution chain of a _product_ must be\\ninterpreted reasonably, in a manner that reflects the _firm’s_ role in that\\n\\n\\nPage 14 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\ndistribution chain and the degree to which it can determine or materially\\ninfluence _retail customer_ outcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.15 G The extent of a _firm’s_ responsibilities under _Principle_ 12 in any one case\\nwill turn on the substance of the _firm’s_ role in the arrangements relating to\\nthe _product_ .

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ .

The actions a\\n_firm_ needs to take to be acting reasonably in such\\ncircumstances may be greater than when a _retail customer_ is\\nmaking decisions which carry a lesser risk of adverse\\n\\noutcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.7.3 G Acting in a way that could reasonably be expected of a prudent _firm_\\nrequires more than adopting a single solution that is reasonable. It includes\\n(among other things) considering whether the preferred solution provides\\ngood outcomes for all _retail customers_ affected or only some; and if only\\nsome, why it does not work for all, and how best to identify additional\\nactions which might mitigate the outcome for those adversely affected.\\n\\n\\nProtected characteristics and characteristics of vulnerability\\n\\n\\n2A.7.4 G In relation to the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_, a _firm_\\nshould, among other things:\\n\\n\\n(1) pay appropriate regard to the nature and scale of characteristics of\\nvulnerability that exist in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) pay appropriate regard to the impact of characteristics of vulnerability\\non the needs of _retail customers_ in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) when dealing with a particular _retail customer_ pay appropriate regard\\nto the needs and characteristics of that _retail customer_, such as\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability;\\n\\n\\n(4) assist frontline staff to understand how to actively identify\\ninformation that could indicate vulnerability and, where relevant,\\nseek information from _retail customers_ with characteristics of\\nvulnerability that will allow staff to respond to their needs; and\\n\\n\\n(5) set up systems and processes in a way that supports and enables _retail_\\n_customers_ with characteristics of vulnerability to disclose their needs.\\n\\n\\nPage 43 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.7.5 G (1) _Firms_ should be aware that groups of _retail customers_ with specific\\nprotected characteristics may have, or be more likely to have,\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability, for example older customers. In\\naddition, where health is a driver of vulnerability it will likely have\\nsubstantial overlap with the protected characteristic of ‘disability’\\nunder the Equality Act 2010. _Firms_ should be mindful of this when\\nconsidering whether they are compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_\\n2A and their obligations under the Equality Act 2010 or equivalent\\nlegislation.\\n\\n\\n(2) _Firms_ should keep themselves appraised of any evidence that may\\nemerge that _retail customers_ with specific protected characteristics\\nare more likely to have characteristics of vulnerability. _Firms_ should\\ntake account of any such evidence when considering whether they are\\ncompliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A and their obligations under\\nthe Equality Act 2010 or equivalent legislation.\\n\\n\\n**2A.8** **Governance and culture**\\n\\n\\nGovernance, strategy and policies\\n\\n\\n2A.8.1 R A _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that _Principle_ 12 and the obligations in this chapter are\\nreflected in their strategies, governance, leadership and people\\npolicies, including incentives at all levels; and\\n\\n\\n(2) ensure that _retail customer_ outcomes are a central focus of:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ risk control arrangements under _SYSC_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) the _firm’s_ internal audit function.\\n\\n\\nStaff incentives\\n\\n\\n2A.8.2 G A _firm_ should not use staff incentives, performance management or\\nremuneration structures in a way that conflicts with their obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A. _Firms_ should be aware that these structures are\\ncapable of causing harm to _retail customers_ and should design their\\nstructures in a way that is consistent with ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\nGoverning body report\\n\\n\\n2A.8.3 R A _firm_ must prepare a report for its governing body setting out the results\\nof its monitoring under _PRIN_ 2A.9 and any actions required as a result of\\nthe monitoring.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.4 R At least annually, the governing body of a _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\nPage 44 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(1) review and approve the _firm’s_ report on the outcomes being received\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) confirm whether it is satisfied that the _firm_ is complying with its\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A; and\\n\\n\\n(3) assess whether the _firm’s_ future business strategy is consistent with\\nits obligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.5 R When approving the _firm’s_ report under _PRIN_ 2A.8.4R(1), the governing\\nbody of the _firm_ must also agree:\\n\\n\\n(1) any action required to address any identified risk that _retail_\\n_customers_ may not receive good outcomes;\\n\\n\\n(2) any action required to address any identified instance where _retail_\\n_customers_ have not received good outcomes; and\\n\\n\\n(3) any amendments to the _firm’s_ business strategy to ensure that it\\nremains consistent with meeting the _firm’s_ obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n**2A.9** **Monitoring of consumer outcomes**\\n\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\n\\n2A.9.1 R This section sets out the general obligation on _firms_ to monitor under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A the outcomes that _retail customers_ are\\nexperiencing from their _products_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.2 G The purpose of the monitoring obligation is to enable _firms_ to identify\\nwhether there are any risks that they are not meeting the requirements of\\nthe cross-cutting obligations and the _retail customer_ outcomes, and\\nconsequently they are not acting to deliver good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.3 G The frequency of monitoring, and the nature of the information a _firm_ must\\ncollect to effectively monitor the outcomes received by _retail customers_\\ndepends on the type of _firm_ and its role in the distribution chain, the nature\\nof the _product_, and the _target market_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.4 G (1) The monitoring obligation applies proportionately to a _firm’s_ role in\\nthe distribution chain.

However, the outcomes _rules_ do not exhaust\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.2 and so those _rules_ are not a comprehensive\\nguide to _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\nPage 63 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.22 G A reasonableness requirement applies to _Rule_ 6 (see _COCON_ 2.4.9R). The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility.

In particular, it does not create a fiduciary\\nrelationship where one would not otherwise exist nor require a _firm_ to\\nprovide advice or carry out any other _regulated activity_ where it would not\\notherwise have done so.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.12 G The _FCA_ has issued guidance on the Consumer Duty in FG22/5, which\\n_firms_ should read alongside _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A as a guide to the\\n_FCA’s_ view as to how _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A might be complied with.\\n\\n\\nGuidance on responsibilities of firms in a product’s distribution chain\\n\\n\\n2A.1.13 G (1) _Principle_ 12 imposes obligations on _firms_ towards _retail customers_ of\\n_products_ irrespective of whether the customer is a _client_ of the _firm_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) This extended application aims to ensure the effectiveness of\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 which may properly relate to activities\\nwhich determine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes\\ncarried out by a _firm_ with whom the _retail customer_ is not in a _client_\\nrelationship.\\n\\n\\n(3) A _firm’s_ role in the distribution chain may mean it is unable to\\ndetermine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes in\\nconnection with the _product_ . If so, the _firm_ may not be subject to any\\nobligation under _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.14 G Obligations on _firms_ in the distribution chain of a _product_ must be\\ninterpreted reasonably, in a manner that reflects the _firm’s_ role in that\\n\\n\\nPage 14 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\ndistribution chain and the degree to which it can determine or materially\\ninfluence _retail customer_ outcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.15 G The extent of a _firm’s_ responsibilities under _Principle_ 12 in any one case\\nwill turn on the substance of the _firm’s_ role in the arrangements relating to\\nthe _product_ . A _firm_ which determines or has a material influence over _retail_\\n_customer_ outcomes is accountable notwithstanding that the _retail customer_\\nmay not be its _client_ due to the indirect nature of their relationship.\\n\\n\\nRelevance of guidance about Principles 6 and 7\\n\\n\\n2A.1.16 G Given the high-level nature and breadth of application of the _Principles_,\\nguidance about a _Principle_ cannot exhaustively cover its implications (see\\nalso _PRIN_ 1.1.9G).\\n\\n\\n2A.1.17 G (1) In general terms, _Principle_ 12 imposes a higher and more exacting\\nstandard of conduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_\\nrelative to what _Principles_ 6 or 7 would have otherwise required.\\n_Principle_ 12 also has a broader application in relation to a _firm’s_\\n_retail market business_ relative to _Principles_ 6 and 7, with a greater\\nfocus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_\\nrelationship with that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n(2) While existing, formal guidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 will remain\\nrelevant to _firms_ in considering their obligations under _Principle_ 12,\\n_firms_ should also take due account of the inherent limits of such\\nguidance in light of the factors in (1). See also _PRIN_ 2A.1.3G.\\n\\n\\n(3) To the extent that a _firm_ is not acting in accordance with existing\\nguidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 and the behaviour would amount to a\\nbreach of _Principle_ 6 or 7 in the event that they had continued to\\napply, the behaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n(4) Where a _firm_ is acting in accordance with guidance on _Principles_ 6\\nand 7 that should not be relied on alone in considering how to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12. _Firms_ also need to consider all their\\nobligations not only under the _Principles_, but under any other\\napplicable law, including other _FCA rules_ such as those expanding\\nupon _Principle_ 12 as set out in _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.18 G The effect of _PRIN_ 3.2.10R is that the application of _Principles_ 6 and 7 is\\nunchanged with respect to a _firm’s_ activities insofar as they are not subject\\nto _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n**2A.2** **Cross-cutting obligations**\\n\\n\\nAct in good faith\\n\\n\\n2A.2.1 R A _firm_ must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 15 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.2.2 R Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by honesty, fair\\nand open dealing and acting consistently with the reasonable expectations\\nof _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.2.3 G Examples of where a _firm_ is not acting in good faith would include:\\n\\n\\n(a) failing to take account of _retail customers’_ interests, for example in\\nthe way it designs a _product_ or presents information;\\n\\n\\n(b) seeking inappropriately to manipulate or exploit _retail customers_, for\\nexample by manipulating or exploiting their emotions or behavioural\\nbiases to mis-lead or create a demand for a _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(c) taking advantage of a _retail customer_ or their circumstances, for\\nexample any characteristics of vulnerability, in a manner which is\\nlikely to cause detriment;\\n\\n\\n(d) carrying out the same activity to a higher standard or more quickly\\nwhen it benefits the _firm_ than when it benefits the _retail customer_,\\nwithout objective justification.\\n\\n\\n2A.2.4 G Acting in good faith does not mean a _firm_ is prevented from pursuing\\nlegitimate commercial interests or seeking a profit, provided it does so in a\\nmanner which is compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ . Long-term products\\nwhere the outcome is not easy to predict, or non-standard\\ncharging structures, or other features which may not be easy\\nfor _retail customers_ to understand may require greater care\\nfrom a _firm_ to promote, monitor and support consumer\\nunderstanding;\\n\\n\\n(c) the costs, fees and charges involved with the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the relative utility to _retail customers_ of the _product_ as a\\nwhole and of specific features, options, or services within the\\n_product_, if subject to separate fees or charges;\\n\\n\\n(2) the characteristics of the _retail customer_ or _retail customers_\\nincluding (to the extent that a _firm_ either knows about or should\\nreasonably have known about them), in particular:\\n\\n\\n(a) their reasonable expectations in relation to the _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) their resources, degree of financial capability or\\nsophistication, characteristics of vulnerability and corporate\\nstructure (where relevant).\\n\\n\\n(3) the _firm’s_ role in relation to the _product_, including:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ . Acting\\nreasonably does not require a _firm_ to assume a fiduciary duty\\nor require an advisory service where it does not already exist;\\n\\n\\nPage 42 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(b) whether the _firm_ has provided or will provide advice to the\\n_retail customer_ . What is reasonable may be different where\\nadvice is being provided;\\n\\n\\n(c) the _firm’s_ role in the _product’s_ distribution chain, in particular\\nits role in determining or materially influencing outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ in relation to the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the stage in the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ .\\nThere will be times when _retail customers_ are particularly\\nexposed to harm, for example when they fall into arrears or\\nare considering long-term investment decisions. The actions a\\n_firm_ needs to take to be acting reasonably in such\\ncircumstances may be greater than when a _retail customer_ is\\nmaking decisions which carry a lesser risk of adverse\\n\\noutcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.7.3 G Acting in a way that could reasonably be expected of a prudent _firm_\\nrequires more than adopting a single solution that is reasonable. It includes\\n(among other things) considering whether the preferred solution provides\\ngood outcomes for all _retail customers_ affected or only some; and if only\\nsome, why it does not work for all, and how best to identify additional\\nactions which might mitigate the outcome for those adversely affected.\\n\\n\\nProtected characteristics and characteristics of vulnerability\\n\\n\\n2A.7.4 G In relation to the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_, a _firm_\\nshould, among other things:\\n\\n\\n(1) pay appropriate regard to the nature and scale of characteristics of\\nvulnerability that exist in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) pay appropriate regard to the impact of characteristics of vulnerability\\non the needs of _retail customers_ in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) when dealing with a particular _retail customer_ pay appropriate regard\\nto the needs and characteristics of that _retail customer_, such as\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability;\\n\\n\\n(4) assist frontline staff to understand how to actively identify\\ninformation that could indicate vulnerability and, where relevant,\\nseek information from _retail customers_ with characteristics of\\nvulnerability that will allow staff to respond to their needs; and\\n\\n\\n(5) set up systems and processes in a way that supports and enables _retail_\\n_customers_ with characteristics of vulnerability to disclose their needs.\\n\\n\\nPage 43 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.7.5 G (1) _Firms_ should be aware that groups of _retail customers_ with specific\\nprotected characteristics may have, or be more likely to have,\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability, for example older customers. In\\naddition, where health is a driver of vulnerability it will likely have\\nsubstantial overlap with the protected characteristic of ‘disability’\\nunder the Equality Act 2010. _Firms_ should be mindful of this when\\nconsidering whether they are compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_\\n2A and their obligations under the Equality Act 2010 or equivalent\\nlegislation.\\n\\n\\n(2) _Firms_ should keep themselves appraised of any evidence that may\\nemerge that _retail customers_ with specific protected characteristics\\nare more likely to have characteristics of vulnerability. _Firms_ should\\ntake account of any such evidence when considering whether they are\\ncompliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A and their obligations under\\nthe Equality Act 2010 or equivalent legislation.\\n\\n\\n**2A.8** **Governance and culture**\\n\\n\\nGovernance, strategy and policies\\n\\n\\n2A.8.1 R A _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that _Principle_ 12 and the obligations in this chapter are\\nreflected in their strategies, governance, leadership and people\\npolicies, including incentives at all levels; and\\n\\n\\n(2) ensure that _retail customer_ outcomes are a central focus of:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ risk control arrangements under _SYSC_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) the _firm’s_ internal audit function.\\n\\n\\nStaff incentives\\n\\n\\n2A.8.2 G A _firm_ should not use staff incentives, performance management or\\nremuneration structures in a way that conflicts with their obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A. _Firms_ should be aware that these structures are\\ncapable of causing harm to _retail customers_ and should design their\\nstructures in a way that is consistent with ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\nGoverning body report\\n\\n\\n2A.8.3 R A _firm_ must prepare a report for its governing body setting out the results\\nof its monitoring under _PRIN_ 2A.9 and any actions required as a result of\\nthe monitoring.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.4 R At least annually, the governing body of a _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\nPage 44 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(1) review and approve the _firm’s_ report on the outcomes being received\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) confirm whether it is satisfied that the _firm_ is complying with its\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A; and\\n\\n\\n(3) assess whether the _firm’s_ future business strategy is consistent with\\nits obligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.5 R When approving the _firm’s_ report under _PRIN_ 2A.8.4R(1), the governing\\nbody of the _firm_ must also agree:\\n\\n\\n(1) any action required to address any identified risk that _retail_\\n_customers_ may not receive good outcomes;\\n\\n\\n(2) any action required to address any identified instance where _retail_\\n_customers_ have not received good outcomes; and\\n\\n\\n(3) any amendments to the _firm’s_ business strategy to ensure that it\\nremains consistent with meeting the _firm’s_ obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n**2A.9** **Monitoring of consumer outcomes**\\n\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\n\\n2A.9.1 R This section sets out the general obligation on _firms_ to monitor under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A the outcomes that _retail customers_ are\\nexperiencing from their _products_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.2 G The purpose of the monitoring obligation is to enable _firms_ to identify\\nwhether there are any risks that they are not meeting the requirements of\\nthe cross-cutting obligations and the _retail customer_ outcomes, and\\nconsequently they are not acting to deliver good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.3 G The frequency of monitoring, and the nature of the information a _firm_ must\\ncollect to effectively monitor the outcomes received by _retail customers_\\ndepends on the type of _firm_ and its role in the distribution chain, the nature\\nof the _product_, and the _target market_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.4 G (1) The monitoring obligation applies proportionately to a _firm’s_ role in\\nthe distribution chain.

However, the outcomes _rules_ do not exhaust\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.2 and so those _rules_ are not a comprehensive\\nguide to _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\nPage 63 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.22 G A reasonableness requirement applies to _Rule_ 6 (see _COCON_ 2.4.9R). The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility. This is particularly the case for _SMF_\\n_managers_ who are members of their _firm’s governing body_ or other senior\\n\\n_’_\\nmanagement forums and for other members of a _firm_ _s governing body_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.34 G On the other hand, the scope of the job of a junior staff member carrying out\\na back office function may not give much of an opportunity to take steps to\\nensure good outcomes for a _retail customer_ on the sale of a _product_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.35 G A salesperson or a member of the customer support staff is likely to have a\\nsignificant influence on the outcomes that a _retail customer_ receives. This is\\nthe case even if they are junior or subject to a detailed set of procedures.\\n\\n\\n**4.2** **Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nSC4: You must disclose appropriately any information of which the FCA or PRA\\nwould reasonably expect notice\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.2.30 G …\\n\\n\\n4.2.31 G The fact that the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_ works is under an\\nobligation to report something to the _FCA_ is relevant to the _SMF manager’s_\\nduties under SC4. So for example if the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_\\nworks is obliged by _PRIN_ 2A.9.17R to notify the _FCA_ that another _firm_ is not\\nor may not be complying with _Principle_ 12 or _PRIN_ 2A, the _SMF manager_\\nshould:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that the _firm_ reports that to the _FCA_ (or do so themselves) if\\nthe matter is within the scope of the _SMF manager’s_ responsibilities;\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\n(2) check whether the _firm_ has notified the matter if the matter is outside\\nthe responsibilities of the _SMF manager_ but the _SMF manager_ is\\nunable to assume that the _firm_ has notified it.\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 66 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex D**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the General Provisions (GEN)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text.\\n\\n\\n**2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**2.2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nGuidance applying while a firm has temporary permission\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n2.2.35A G A _TP firm_ should refer to the provisions listed below, which identify the _rules_\\nand _guidance_ in their sourcebooks that came into force after _IP completion day_\\nand in respect of which special provision has been made to apply them to _TP_\\n_firms_ .\\n\\n\\n_PRIN_ 3.1.13R,\\n\\n\\n_COBS_ 1.1.1CR,\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 67 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex E**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the Product Intervention and Product Governance sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text and striking through indicates deleted text.\\n\\n\\n**1** **Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**1.3** **Application of PROD 3**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nOther firms manufacturing or distributing financial instruments or structured\\ndeposits\\n\\n\\n1.3.2 R (1) Subject to (2) ~~Other~~ other _firms_ which _manufacture_ or _distribute_\\n_financial instruments_ or _structured deposits_ should take account of\\n_PROD_ 3 as if it were _guidance_ on the _Principles_ and other relevant _rules_\\nand as if “should” appeared in _PROD_ 3 rules instead of “must”.\\n\\n\\n(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a _firm_ to the extent that it is required to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12 (Consumer Duty) and _PRIN_ 2A in relation to\\na _product_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 68 of 68\\n\\n\\nPub ref: 007833\\n\\n\\n© Financial Conduct Authority 2022\\n12 Endeavour Square London E20 1JN\\nTelephone: +44 (0)20 7066 1000\\nWebsite: www.fca.org.uk\\nAll rights reserved</chunk>\")], [Document(metadata={'country': 'UK', 'source': 'FCA Consumer Duty Final Rules', '_id': '358c741c-b84a-4c38-93ca-3dce267d5bc2', '_collection_name': 'insurance-policies'}, page_content='<chunk_context>This section introduces the Policy Statement PS22/9, issued by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in July 2022, which details the final rules and feedback related to the new Consumer Duty following Consultation Paper 21/36.

We want to\\ndrive a healthy and successful financial services system in which firms can thrive and\\nconsumers can make informed choices about financial products and services.\\n\\n\\n1.3 Setting higher standards and putting consumers’ needs first is central to our strategy\\n– and the cornerstone of this is the Duty. We want to see a higher level of consumer\\nprotection in retail financial markets, where firms compete vigorously in consumers’\\ninterests. Firms need to understand their customers’ needs and to have the flexibility\\nto support them with certainty of our expectations, so they get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n1.4 This is particularly important as consumers face increasing pressures, including those\\nrelating to the cost of living. Even before cost of living pressures emerged, consumers\\nwere being asked to make an increasing number of complex and important decisions\\nin a faster and increasingly complex environment. This makes it even more important\\nthat consumers can make informed, effective decisions, act in their interests and\\npursue their financial objectives.\\n\\n\\n1.5 At present, this doesn’t always happen. Some firms present information in a way that\\nis misleading or difficult to understand, which makes it harder for consumers to make a\\ntimely and informed decision. Some firms sell products or services to consumers that\\nare not right for them or which don’t offer fair value or provide poor customer service\\nand support.\\n\\n\\n1.6 We have addressed these poor practices over time with our regulatory and supervisory\\ntools. Under the Duty, firms will need to assess and evidence the extent to which and\\nhow they are acting to deliver good outcomes. Combined with our more data‑led\\napproach, this should enable us to more quickly identify practices that negatively\\naffect those outcomes and to intervene before practices become widespread.\\n\\n\\n1.7 A more outcome‑focused approach will also give firms greater flexibility to adapt and\\ninnovate. Outcomes‑based regulation can be applied more easily to technological\\nchange and market developments than detailed and prescriptive rules. This means\\nconsumers are better protected from new and emerging harms. Firms can also\\ninnovate to find new ways of serving their customers with certainty of our regulatory\\nexpectations.\\n\\n\\n1.8 We have engaged extensively with a wide range of stakeholders as we finalise the\\nrules and guidance for the Duty. This includes consumer organisations, firms and their\\ntrade bodies, members of the regulatory family and other regulators, law firms and\\nprofessional bodies, and our statutory panels. We have also discussed our proposals at\\nnumerous events, panels, and open discussions.\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\nPS22/9\\n\\nChapter 1\\n\\n\\n\\nFinancial Conduct Authority\\nA new Consumer Duty Feedback to CP21/36 and final rules\\n\\n\\n\\n1.9 We are grateful to those who engaged with us, and we have considered the feedback\\nand issues raised. We want to continue this collaborative engagement with all\\nstakeholders in the next and crucial phase of implementation.\\n\\n#### Who this affects\\n\\n\\n       - regulated firms, including those in the e‑money and payments sector\\n\\n       - consumer organisations and individual consumers\\n\\n       - industry groups/trade bodies\\n\\n       - policy makers and regulatory bodies\\n\\n       - industry experts and commentators\\n\\n       - academics and think tanks\\n\\n#### The wider context of this policy statement\\n\\n##### Our consultation\\n\\n\\n1.10 We first discussed stakeholders’ concerns that our regulatory framework may not\\nbe adequate to tackle the level of consumer harm in retail markets in our discussion\\n[paper ‘A duty of care and potential alternative approaches’ (DP18/5). In our subsequent](https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/discussion/dp-18-05.pdf)\\n[feedback statement (FS19/2), we set out our intention to take forward specific options](https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/feedback/fs19-02.pdf)\\nfor change.\\n\\n\\n1.11 [We published a first consultation paper (CP21/13) in May 2021. In December 2021, we](https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/consultation/cp21-13.pdf)\\nconsulted on our detailed and final proposals for the Duty, including draft rules and\\n[guidance (CP21/36). This policy statement sets out the key feedback we received, the](https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/consultation/cp21-36.pdf)\\nchanges we have made in response, and the final rules and guidance.\\n\\n\\n1.12 The question of whether and how to raise the standard of protection for consumers\\nwas also debated in Parliament during the passage of the Financial Services Act 2021\\nwith Parliamentarians calling strongly for change. The Act set out a requirement that\\nthe FCA should consult on:\\n\\n\\n       - whether to make general rules providing that authorised firms owe a duty of care\\nto consumers, including whether to make other provisions about the level of care\\nwhich firms should provide to consumers\\n\\n       - whether such a duty or other provisions should apply to all consumers or to\\nparticular classes of them\\n\\n       - the extent to which a duty or other provisions would advance the FCA’s statutory\\nconsumer protection objective.\\n\\n\\n1.13 Under the Financial Services Act 2021 we are required to make any final rules for the\\nDuty by 31 July 2022. The rules we are making at Appendix 1 fulfil this obligation.\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\nPS22/9\\n\\nChapter 1\\n\\n\\n\\nFinancial Conduct Authority\\nA new Consumer Duty Feedback to CP21/36 and final rules</chunk>\")], [Document(metadata={'country': 'UK', 'source': 'FCA Consumer Duty Final Rules', '_id': '67c7d10a-60c9-41bd-94e4-85aa00281edb', '_collection_name': 'insurance-policies'}, page_content=\"<chunk_context>Annex 1 provides a comprehensive list of non-confidential respondents to the Consultation Paper CP21/36 regarding the new Consumer Duty proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

Further guidance about what can reasonably be\\nexpected and the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_ is set out at\\n_PRIN_ 2A.7.2G to 2A.7.5G.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.7 R References in this chapter (including those within Glossary definitions used\\nin this chapter) to _regulated activities_ include _payment services_ and issuing\\n_electronic money_ (whether or not the activity of _issuing electronic_\\n_money_ specified in _article 9B_ of the _Regulated Activities Order_ ); and unless\\notherwise stated are to be taken to include activities connected to the\\n\\nprovision of _payment services_ and to the issuing of _electronic money_\\n(whether or not the activity of _issuing electronic money_ specified in _article_\\n_9B_ of the _Regulated Activities Order_ ).\\n\\n\\nPurpose\\n\\n\\n2A.1.8 G _Principle_ 12 reflects a general expectation by the _FCA_ that _firms_ should\\nconduct their business to a standard which ensures an appropriate level of\\nprotection for _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.1.9 G While recognising the general principle that _consumers_ should take\\nresponsibility for their decisions, having regard to the other factors set out\\nin s.1C of the _Act_, it is appropriate to require a high level of protection for\\n_retail customers_ for reasons including:\\n\\n\\n(1) that they typically face a weak bargaining position in their\\nrelationships with _firms_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) that they are susceptible to cognitive and behavioural biases;\\n\\n\\nPage 13 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(3) that they may lack experience or expertise in relation to _products_\\noffered through _retail market business_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(4) that there are frequently information asymmetries involved in _retail_\\n_market business_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.1.10 G (1) The cross-cutting obligations at _PRIN_ 2A.2 set out the overarching\\nconduct which _firms_ must demonstrate when they act to deliver good\\noutcomes for _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) The main elements of _firms’_ conduct obligations under _Principle_ 12\\nand _PRIN_ 2A are set out in _PRIN_ 2A.3 to _PRIN_ 2A.11.\\n\\n\\n(3) The _retail customer_ outcome _rules_ and _guidance_ at _PRIN_ 2A.3 to\\n_PRIN_ 2A.6 set out _firms’_ key obligations in relation to product\\ngovernance, price and value, consumer understanding and supporting\\n\\nconsumers.\\n\\n\\n(4) There are particular provisions concerning _closed products_ and\\n_existing products_ _distributed_ to _retail customers_ before 31 July 2023\\nin _PRIN_ 2A.3 and _PRIN_ 2A.4.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.11 G _Principle_ 12 does not change the nature of a _firm’s_ relationship with any\\ngiven _retail customer_ . In particular, it does not create a fiduciary\\nrelationship where one would not otherwise exist nor require a _firm_ to\\nprovide advice or carry out any other _regulated activity_ where it would not\\notherwise have done so.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.12 G The _FCA_ has issued guidance on the Consumer Duty in FG22/5, which\\n_firms_ should read alongside _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A as a guide to the\\n_FCA’s_ view as to how _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A might be complied with.\\n\\n\\nGuidance on responsibilities of firms in a product’s distribution chain\\n\\n\\n2A.1.13 G (1) _Principle_ 12 imposes obligations on _firms_ towards _retail customers_ of\\n_products_ irrespective of whether the customer is a _client_ of the _firm_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) This extended application aims to ensure the effectiveness of\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 which may properly relate to activities\\nwhich determine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes\\ncarried out by a _firm_ with whom the _retail customer_ is not in a _client_\\nrelationship.\\n\\n\\n(3) A _firm’s_ role in the distribution chain may mean it is unable to\\ndetermine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes in\\nconnection with the _product_ . If so, the _firm_ may not be subject to any\\nobligation under _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.14 G Obligations on _firms_ in the distribution chain of a _product_ must be\\ninterpreted reasonably, in a manner that reflects the _firm’s_ role in that\\n\\n\\nPage 14 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\ndistribution chain and the degree to which it can determine or materially\\ninfluence _retail customer_ outcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.15 G The extent of a _firm’s_ responsibilities under _Principle_ 12 in any one case\\nwill turn on the substance of the _firm’s_ role in the arrangements relating to\\nthe _product_ . A _firm_ which determines or has a material influence over _retail_\\n_customer_ outcomes is accountable notwithstanding that the _retail customer_\\nmay not be its _client_ due to the indirect nature of their relationship.\\n\\n\\nRelevance of guidance about Principles 6 and 7\\n\\n\\n2A.1.16 G Given the high-level nature and breadth of application of the _Principles_,\\nguidance about a _Principle_ cannot exhaustively cover its implications (see\\nalso _PRIN_ 1.1.9G).\\n\\n\\n2A.1.17 G (1) In general terms, _Principle_ 12 imposes a higher and more exacting\\nstandard of conduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_\\nrelative to what _Principles_ 6 or 7 would have otherwise required.\\n_Principle_ 12 also has a broader application in relation to a _firm’s_\\n_retail market business_ relative to _Principles_ 6 and 7, with a greater\\nfocus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_\\nrelationship with that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n(2) While existing, formal guidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 will remain\\nrelevant to _firms_ in considering their obligations under _Principle_ 12,\\n_firms_ should also take due account of the inherent limits of such\\nguidance in light of the factors in (1). See also _PRIN_ 2A.1.3G.\\n\\n\\n(3) To the extent that a _firm_ is not acting in accordance with existing\\nguidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 and the behaviour would amount to a\\nbreach of _Principle_ 6 or 7 in the event that they had continued to\\napply, the behaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n(4) Where a _firm_ is acting in accordance with guidance on _Principles_ 6\\nand 7 that should not be relied on alone in considering how to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12. _Firms_ also need to consider all their\\nobligations not only under the _Principles_, but under any other\\napplicable law, including other _FCA rules_ such as those expanding\\nupon _Principle_ 12 as set out in _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.18 G The effect of _PRIN_ 3.2.10R is that the application of _Principles_ 6 and 7 is\\nunchanged with respect to a _firm’s_ activities insofar as they are not subject\\nto _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n**2A.2** **Cross-cutting obligations**\\n\\n\\nAct in good faith\\n\\n\\n2A.2.1 R A _firm_ must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 15 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.2.2 R Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by honesty, fair\\nand open dealing and acting consistently with the reasonable expectations\\nof _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.2.3 G Examples of where a _firm_ is not acting in good faith would include:\\n\\n\\n(a) failing to take account of _retail customers’_ interests, for example in\\nthe way it designs a _product_ or presents information;\\n\\n\\n(b) seeking inappropriately to manipulate or exploit _retail customers_, for\\nexample by manipulating or exploiting their emotions or behavioural\\nbiases to mis-lead or create a demand for a _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(c) taking advantage of a _retail customer_ or their circumstances, for\\nexample any characteristics of vulnerability, in a manner which is\\nlikely to cause detriment;\\n\\n\\n(d) carrying out the same activity to a higher standard or more quickly\\nwhen it benefits the _firm_ than when it benefits the _retail customer_,\\nwithout objective justification.\\n\\n\\n2A.2.4 G Acting in good faith does not mean a _firm_ is prevented from pursuing\\nlegitimate commercial interests or seeking a profit, provided it does so in a\\nmanner which is compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ . Long-term products\\nwhere the outcome is not easy to predict, or non-standard\\ncharging structures, or other features which may not be easy\\nfor _retail customers_ to understand may require greater care\\nfrom a _firm_ to promote, monitor and support consumer\\nunderstanding;\\n\\n\\n(c) the costs, fees and charges involved with the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the relative utility to _retail customers_ of the _product_ as a\\nwhole and of specific features, options, or services within the\\n_product_, if subject to separate fees or charges;\\n\\n\\n(2) the characteristics of the _retail customer_ or _retail customers_\\nincluding (to the extent that a _firm_ either knows about or should\\nreasonably have known about them), in particular:\\n\\n\\n(a) their reasonable expectations in relation to the _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) their resources, degree of financial capability or\\nsophistication, characteristics of vulnerability and corporate\\nstructure (where relevant).\\n\\n\\n(3) the _firm’s_ role in relation to the _product_, including:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ . Acting\\nreasonably does not require a _firm_ to assume a fiduciary duty\\nor require an advisory service where it does not already exist;\\n\\n\\nPage 42 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(b) whether the _firm_ has provided or will provide advice to the\\n_retail customer_ . What is reasonable may be different where\\nadvice is being provided;\\n\\n\\n(c) the _firm’s_ role in the _product’s_ distribution chain, in particular\\nits role in determining or materially influencing outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ in relation to the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the stage in the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ .\\nThere will be times when _retail customers_ are particularly\\nexposed to harm, for example when they fall into arrears or\\nare considering long-term investment decisions. The actions a\\n_firm_ needs to take to be acting reasonably in such\\ncircumstances may be greater than when a _retail customer_ is\\nmaking decisions which carry a lesser risk of adverse\\n\\noutcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.7.3 G Acting in a way that could reasonably be expected of a prudent _firm_\\nrequires more than adopting a single solution that is reasonable. It includes\\n(among other things) considering whether the preferred solution provides\\ngood outcomes for all _retail customers_ affected or only some; and if only\\nsome, why it does not work for all, and how best to identify additional\\nactions which might mitigate the outcome for those adversely affected.\\n\\n\\nProtected characteristics and characteristics of vulnerability\\n\\n\\n2A.7.4 G In relation to the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_, a _firm_\\nshould, among other things:\\n\\n\\n(1) pay appropriate regard to the nature and scale of characteristics of\\nvulnerability that exist in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) pay appropriate regard to the impact of characteristics of vulnerability\\non the needs of _retail customers_ in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) when dealing with a particular _retail customer_ pay appropriate regard\\nto the needs and characteristics of that _retail customer_, such as\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability;\\n\\n\\n(4) assist frontline staff to understand how to actively identify\\ninformation that could indicate vulnerability and, where relevant,\\nseek information from _retail customers_ with characteristics of\\nvulnerability that will allow staff to respond to their needs; and\\n\\n\\n(5) set up systems and processes in a way that supports and enables _retail_\\n_customers_ with characteristics of vulnerability to disclose their needs.\\n\\n\\nPage 43 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.7.5 G (1) _Firms_ should be aware that groups of _retail customers_ with specific\\nprotected characteristics may have, or be more likely to have,\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability, for example older customers. In\\naddition, where health is a driver of vulnerability it will likely have\\nsubstantial overlap with the protected characteristic of ‘disability’\\nunder the Equality Act 2010. _Firms_ should be mindful of this when\\nconsidering whether they are compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_\\n2A and their obligations under the Equality Act 2010 or equivalent\\nlegislation.\\n\\n\\n(2) _Firms_ should keep themselves appraised of any evidence that may\\nemerge that _retail customers_ with specific protected characteristics\\nare more likely to have characteristics of vulnerability. _Firms_ should\\ntake account of any such evidence when considering whether they are\\ncompliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A and their obligations under\\nthe Equality Act 2010 or equivalent legislation.\\n\\n\\n**2A.8** **Governance and culture**\\n\\n\\nGovernance, strategy and policies\\n\\n\\n2A.8.1 R A _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that _Principle_ 12 and the obligations in this chapter are\\nreflected in their strategies, governance, leadership and people\\npolicies, including incentives at all levels; and\\n\\n\\n(2) ensure that _retail customer_ outcomes are a central focus of:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ risk control arrangements under _SYSC_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) the _firm’s_ internal audit function.\\n\\n\\nStaff incentives\\n\\n\\n2A.8.2 G A _firm_ should not use staff incentives, performance management or\\nremuneration structures in a way that conflicts with their obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A. _Firms_ should be aware that these structures are\\ncapable of causing harm to _retail customers_ and should design their\\nstructures in a way that is consistent with ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\nGoverning body report\\n\\n\\n2A.8.3 R A _firm_ must prepare a report for its governing body setting out the results\\nof its monitoring under _PRIN_ 2A.9 and any actions required as a result of\\nthe monitoring.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.4 R At least annually, the governing body of a _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\nPage 44 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(1) review and approve the _firm’s_ report on the outcomes being received\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) confirm whether it is satisfied that the _firm_ is complying with its\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A; and\\n\\n\\n(3) assess whether the _firm’s_ future business strategy is consistent with\\nits obligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.5 R When approving the _firm’s_ report under _PRIN_ 2A.8.4R(1), the governing\\nbody of the _firm_ must also agree:\\n\\n\\n(1) any action required to address any identified risk that _retail_\\n_customers_ may not receive good outcomes;\\n\\n\\n(2) any action required to address any identified instance where _retail_\\n_customers_ have not received good outcomes; and\\n\\n\\n(3) any amendments to the _firm’s_ business strategy to ensure that it\\nremains consistent with meeting the _firm’s_ obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n**2A.9** **Monitoring of consumer outcomes**\\n\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\n\\n2A.9.1 R This section sets out the general obligation on _firms_ to monitor under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A the outcomes that _retail customers_ are\\nexperiencing from their _products_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.2 G The purpose of the monitoring obligation is to enable _firms_ to identify\\nwhether there are any risks that they are not meeting the requirements of\\nthe cross-cutting obligations and the _retail customer_ outcomes, and\\nconsequently they are not acting to deliver good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.3 G The frequency of monitoring, and the nature of the information a _firm_ must\\ncollect to effectively monitor the outcomes received by _retail customers_\\ndepends on the type of _firm_ and its role in the distribution chain, the nature\\nof the _product_, and the _target market_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.4 G (1) The monitoring obligation applies proportionately to a _firm’s_ role in\\nthe distribution chain.

This is in particular the effect of paragraphs (2)(f)\\nand (2)(g) of the definition of _retail customer_ .\\n\\n\\nObligations: Introduction\\n\\n\\n2.4.5 R (1) _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R exhaust what is required by _Rule_\\n6.\\n\\n\\n(2) Any reference in the _Handbook_ to the obligations on a member of a\\n_firm’s conduct rules staff_ under _Rule_ 6 is a reference to the\\nrequirements imposed by _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R.\\n\\n\\nObligations: Rules\\n\\n\\n2.4.6 R (1) You must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by\\nhonesty, fair and open dealing and acting consistently with the\\nreasonable expectations of _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.7 R You must avoid causing foreseeable harm to _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.8 R You must enable and support _retail customers_ to pursue their financial\\nobjectives.\\n\\n\\nReasonable application of Individual Conduct Rule 6\\n\\n\\n2.4.9 R The obligations in _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the standard\\nthat could reasonably be expected of a prudent _person_ subject to _COCON_ (as\\nset out in _COCON_ 1 (Application)):\\n\\n\\n(1) carrying on the same activity in relation to the same _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\nPage 62 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(2) taking appropriate account of the needs and characteristics of _retail_\\n_customers_ based on the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_\\nin the relevant target market or of individual _retail customers_ as the\\ncontext requires.\\n\\n\\nReferences to Principle 12\\n\\n\\n2.4.10 R Any reference in _COCON_ to _Principle_ 12 must be read in accordance with\\n_PRIN_ 2A.1.1R and _PRIN_ 2A.1.2R (Application) and _PRIN_ 2A.2.26R\\n(Interaction between Principle 12 and cross-cutting obligations).\\n\\n\\nAmend the following as shown.\\n\\n\\n**4** **Specific guidance on** ~~**individual**~~ **conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n**4.1** **Specific guidance on individual conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.1.18 G …\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relevance of\\nrules and guidance in PRIN\\n\\n\\n4.1.19 G The _guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2 (Cross-cutting obligations) will also be helpful\\nin interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.20 G (1) The _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2, insofar as not mirrored in _COCON_, will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus\\n_Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n(2) So for example, in line with _PRIN_ 2A.2.9R, in _COCON_ 2.4.7R:\\n\\n\\n(a) foreseeable harm may be caused by both act and omission;\\n\\n\\n(b) if the relationship of the _firm_ for which the relevant member\\nof its _conduct rules staff_ works with a _retail customer_ is\\nthrough its role in a distribution chain, foreseeable harm may\\nbe caused even where another _firm_ in that chain also\\ncontributes to the harm; and\\n\\n\\n(c) foreseeable harm may be caused even where another _person_\\nworking for the _firm_ is also responsible for or contributes to\\nthe harm.\\n\\n\\n4.1.21 G The outcomes _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.3 to _PRIN_ 2A.6 are also useful in defining\\nwhat is required by _Rule_ 6. However, the outcomes _rules_ do not exhaust\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.2 and so those _rules_ are not a comprehensive\\nguide to _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\nPage 63 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.22 G A reasonableness requirement applies to _Rule_ 6 (see _COCON_ 2.4.9R). The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility. This is particularly the case for _SMF_\\n_managers_ who are members of their _firm’s governing body_ or other senior\\n\\n_’_\\nmanagement forums and for other members of a _firm_ _s governing body_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.34 G On the other hand, the scope of the job of a junior staff member carrying out\\na back office function may not give much of an opportunity to take steps to\\nensure good outcomes for a _retail customer_ on the sale of a _product_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.35 G A salesperson or a member of the customer support staff is likely to have a\\nsignificant influence on the outcomes that a _retail customer_ receives. This is\\nthe case even if they are junior or subject to a detailed set of procedures.\\n\\n\\n**4.2** **Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nSC4: You must disclose appropriately any information of which the FCA or PRA\\nwould reasonably expect notice\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.2.30 G …\\n\\n\\n4.2.31 G The fact that the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_ works is under an\\nobligation to report something to the _FCA_ is relevant to the _SMF manager’s_\\nduties under SC4. So for example if the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_\\nworks is obliged by _PRIN_ 2A.9.17R to notify the _FCA_ that another _firm_ is not\\nor may not be complying with _Principle_ 12 or _PRIN_ 2A, the _SMF manager_\\nshould:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that the _firm_ reports that to the _FCA_ (or do so themselves) if\\nthe matter is within the scope of the _SMF manager’s_ responsibilities;\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\n(2) check whether the _firm_ has notified the matter if the matter is outside\\nthe responsibilities of the _SMF manager_ but the _SMF manager_ is\\nunable to assume that the _firm_ has notified it.\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 66 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex D**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the General Provisions (GEN)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text.\\n\\n\\n**2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**2.2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nGuidance applying while a firm has temporary permission\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n2.2.35A G A _TP firm_ should refer to the provisions listed below, which identify the _rules_\\nand _guidance_ in their sourcebooks that came into force after _IP completion day_\\nand in respect of which special provision has been made to apply them to _TP_\\n_firms_ .\\n\\n\\n_PRIN_ 3.1.13R,\\n\\n\\n_COBS_ 1.1.1CR,\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 67 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex E**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the Product Intervention and Product Governance sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text and striking through indicates deleted text.\\n\\n\\n**1** **Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**1.3** **Application of PROD 3**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nOther firms manufacturing or distributing financial instruments or structured\\ndeposits\\n\\n\\n1.3.2 R (1) Subject to (2) ~~Other~~ other _firms_ which _manufacture_ or _distribute_\\n_financial instruments_ or _structured deposits_ should take account of\\n_PROD_ 3 as if it were _guidance_ on the _Principles_ and other relevant _rules_\\nand as if “should” appeared in _PROD_ 3 rules instead of “must”.\\n\\n\\n(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a _firm_ to the extent that it is required to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12 (Consumer Duty) and _PRIN_ 2A in relation to\\na _product_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 68 of 68\\n\\n\\nPub ref: 007833\\n\\n\\n© Financial Conduct Authority 2022\\n12 Endeavour Square London E20 1JN\\nTelephone: +44 (0)20 7066 1000\\nWebsite: www.fca.org.uk\\nAll rights reserved</chunk>\")], [Document(metadata={'country': 'UK', 'source': 'FCA Consumer Duty Final Rules', '_id': '67c7d10a-60c9-41bd-94e4-85aa00281edb', '_collection_name': 'insurance-policies'}, page_content=\"<chunk_context>Annex 1 provides a comprehensive list of non-confidential respondents to the Consultation Paper CP21/36 regarding the new Consumer Duty proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ .

The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility.

In particular, it does not create a fiduciary\\nrelationship where one would not otherwise exist nor require a _firm_ to\\nprovide advice or carry out any other _regulated activity_ where it would not\\notherwise have done so.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.12 G The _FCA_ has issued guidance on the Consumer Duty in FG22/5, which\\n_firms_ should read alongside _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A as a guide to the\\n_FCA’s_ view as to how _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A might be complied with.\\n\\n\\nGuidance on responsibilities of firms in a product’s distribution chain\\n\\n\\n2A.1.13 G (1) _Principle_ 12 imposes obligations on _firms_ towards _retail customers_ of\\n_products_ irrespective of whether the customer is a _client_ of the _firm_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) This extended application aims to ensure the effectiveness of\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 which may properly relate to activities\\nwhich determine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes\\ncarried out by a _firm_ with whom the _retail customer_ is not in a _client_\\nrelationship.\\n\\n\\n(3) A _firm’s_ role in the distribution chain may mean it is unable to\\ndetermine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes in\\nconnection with the _product_ . If so, the _firm_ may not be subject to any\\nobligation under _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.14 G Obligations on _firms_ in the distribution chain of a _product_ must be\\ninterpreted reasonably, in a manner that reflects the _firm’s_ role in that\\n\\n\\nPage 14 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\ndistribution chain and the degree to which it can determine or materially\\ninfluence _retail customer_ outcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.15 G The extent of a _firm’s_ responsibilities under _Principle_ 12 in any one case\\nwill turn on the substance of the _firm’s_ role in the arrangements relating to\\nthe _product_ . A _firm_ which determines or has a material influence over _retail_\\n_customer_ outcomes is accountable notwithstanding that the _retail customer_\\nmay not be its _client_ due to the indirect nature of their relationship.\\n\\n\\nRelevance of guidance about Principles 6 and 7\\n\\n\\n2A.1.16 G Given the high-level nature and breadth of application of the _Principles_,\\nguidance about a _Principle_ cannot exhaustively cover its implications (see\\nalso _PRIN_ 1.1.9G).\\n\\n\\n2A.1.17 G (1) In general terms, _Principle_ 12 imposes a higher and more exacting\\nstandard of conduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_\\nrelative to what _Principles_ 6 or 7 would have otherwise required.\\n_Principle_ 12 also has a broader application in relation to a _firm’s_\\n_retail market business_ relative to _Principles_ 6 and 7, with a greater\\nfocus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_\\nrelationship with that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n(2) While existing, formal guidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 will remain\\nrelevant to _firms_ in considering their obligations under _Principle_ 12,\\n_firms_ should also take due account of the inherent limits of such\\nguidance in light of the factors in (1). See also _PRIN_ 2A.1.3G.\\n\\n\\n(3) To the extent that a _firm_ is not acting in accordance with existing\\nguidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 and the behaviour would amount to a\\nbreach of _Principle_ 6 or 7 in the event that they had continued to\\napply, the behaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n(4) Where a _firm_ is acting in accordance with guidance on _Principles_ 6\\nand 7 that should not be relied on alone in considering how to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12. _Firms_ also need to consider all their\\nobligations not only under the _Principles_, but under any other\\napplicable law, including other _FCA rules_ such as those expanding\\nupon _Principle_ 12 as set out in _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.18 G The effect of _PRIN_ 3.2.10R is that the application of _Principles_ 6 and 7 is\\nunchanged with respect to a _firm’s_ activities insofar as they are not subject\\nto _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n**2A.2** **Cross-cutting obligations**\\n\\n\\nAct in good faith\\n\\n\\n2A.2.1 R A _firm_ must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 15 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.2.2 R Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by honesty, fair\\nand open dealing and acting consistently with the reasonable expectations\\nof _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.2.3 G Examples of where a _firm_ is not acting in good faith would include:\\n\\n\\n(a) failing to take account of _retail customers’_ interests, for example in\\nthe way it designs a _product_ or presents information;\\n\\n\\n(b) seeking inappropriately to manipulate or exploit _retail customers_, for\\nexample by manipulating or exploiting their emotions or behavioural\\nbiases to mis-lead or create a demand for a _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(c) taking advantage of a _retail customer_ or their circumstances, for\\nexample any characteristics of vulnerability, in a manner which is\\nlikely to cause detriment;\\n\\n\\n(d) carrying out the same activity to a higher standard or more quickly\\nwhen it benefits the _firm_ than when it benefits the _retail customer_,\\nwithout objective justification.\\n\\n\\n2A.2.4 G Acting in good faith does not mean a _firm_ is prevented from pursuing\\nlegitimate commercial interests or seeking a profit, provided it does so in a\\nmanner which is compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ . Long-term products\\nwhere the outcome is not easy to predict, or non-standard\\ncharging structures, or other features which may not be easy\\nfor _retail customers_ to understand may require greater care\\nfrom a _firm_ to promote, monitor and support consumer\\nunderstanding;\\n\\n\\n(c) the costs, fees and charges involved with the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the relative utility to _retail customers_ of the _product_ as a\\nwhole and of specific features, options, or services within the\\n_product_, if subject to separate fees or charges;\\n\\n\\n(2) the characteristics of the _retail customer_ or _retail customers_\\nincluding (to the extent that a _firm_ either knows about or should\\nreasonably have known about them), in particular:\\n\\n\\n(a) their reasonable expectations in relation to the _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) their resources, degree of financial capability or\\nsophistication, characteristics of vulnerability and corporate\\nstructure (where relevant).\\n\\n\\n(3) the _firm’s_ role in relation to the _product_, including:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ . Acting\\nreasonably does not require a _firm_ to assume a fiduciary duty\\nor require an advisory service where it does not already exist;\\n\\n\\nPage 42 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(b) whether the _firm_ has provided or will provide advice to the\\n_retail customer_ . What is reasonable may be different where\\nadvice is being provided;\\n\\n\\n(c) the _firm’s_ role in the _product’s_ distribution chain, in particular\\nits role in determining or materially influencing outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ in relation to the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the stage in the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ .\\nThere will be times when _retail customers_ are particularly\\nexposed to harm, for example when they fall into arrears or\\nare considering long-term investment decisions. The actions a\\n_firm_ needs to take to be acting reasonably in such\\ncircumstances may be greater than when a _retail customer_ is\\nmaking decisions which carry a lesser risk of adverse\\n\\noutcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.7.3 G Acting in a way that could reasonably be expected of a prudent _firm_\\nrequires more than adopting a single solution that is reasonable. It includes\\n(among other things) considering whether the preferred solution provides\\ngood outcomes for all _retail customers_ affected or only some; and if only\\nsome, why it does not work for all, and how best to identify additional\\nactions which might mitigate the outcome for those adversely affected.\\n\\n\\nProtected characteristics and characteristics of vulnerability\\n\\n\\n2A.7.4 G In relation to the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_, a _firm_\\nshould, among other things:\\n\\n\\n(1) pay appropriate regard to the nature and scale of characteristics of\\nvulnerability that exist in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) pay appropriate regard to the impact of characteristics of vulnerability\\non the needs of _retail customers_ in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) when dealing with a particular _retail customer_ pay appropriate regard\\nto the needs and characteristics of that _retail customer_, such as\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability;\\n\\n\\n(4) assist frontline staff to understand how to actively identify\\ninformation that could indicate vulnerability and, where relevant,\\nseek information from _retail customers_ with characteristics of\\nvulnerability that will allow staff to respond to their needs; and\\n\\n\\n(5) set up systems and processes in a way that supports and enables _retail_\\n_customers_ with characteristics of vulnerability to disclose their needs.\\n\\n\\nPage 43 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.7.5 G (1) _Firms_ should be aware that groups of _retail customers_ with specific\\nprotected characteristics may have, or be more likely to have,\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability, for example older customers. In\\naddition, where health is a driver of vulnerability it will likely have\\nsubstantial overlap with the protected characteristic of ‘disability’\\nunder the Equality Act 2010. _Firms_ should be mindful of this when\\nconsidering whether they are compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_\\n2A and their obligations under the Equality Act 2010 or equivalent\\nlegislation.\\n\\n\\n(2) _Firms_ should keep themselves appraised of any evidence that may\\nemerge that _retail customers_ with specific protected characteristics\\nare more likely to have characteristics of vulnerability. _Firms_ should\\ntake account of any such evidence when considering whether they are\\ncompliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A and their obligations under\\nthe Equality Act 2010 or equivalent legislation.\\n\\n\\n**2A.8** **Governance and culture**\\n\\n\\nGovernance, strategy and policies\\n\\n\\n2A.8.1 R A _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that _Principle_ 12 and the obligations in this chapter are\\nreflected in their strategies, governance, leadership and people\\npolicies, including incentives at all levels; and\\n\\n\\n(2) ensure that _retail customer_ outcomes are a central focus of:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ risk control arrangements under _SYSC_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) the _firm’s_ internal audit function.\\n\\n\\nStaff incentives\\n\\n\\n2A.8.2 G A _firm_ should not use staff incentives, performance management or\\nremuneration structures in a way that conflicts with their obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A. _Firms_ should be aware that these structures are\\ncapable of causing harm to _retail customers_ and should design their\\nstructures in a way that is consistent with ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\nGoverning body report\\n\\n\\n2A.8.3 R A _firm_ must prepare a report for its governing body setting out the results\\nof its monitoring under _PRIN_ 2A.9 and any actions required as a result of\\nthe monitoring.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.4 R At least annually, the governing body of a _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\nPage 44 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(1) review and approve the _firm’s_ report on the outcomes being received\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) confirm whether it is satisfied that the _firm_ is complying with its\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A; and\\n\\n\\n(3) assess whether the _firm’s_ future business strategy is consistent with\\nits obligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.5 R When approving the _firm’s_ report under _PRIN_ 2A.8.4R(1), the governing\\nbody of the _firm_ must also agree:\\n\\n\\n(1) any action required to address any identified risk that _retail_\\n_customers_ may not receive good outcomes;\\n\\n\\n(2) any action required to address any identified instance where _retail_\\n_customers_ have not received good outcomes; and\\n\\n\\n(3) any amendments to the _firm’s_ business strategy to ensure that it\\nremains consistent with meeting the _firm’s_ obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n**2A.9** **Monitoring of consumer outcomes**\\n\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\n\\n2A.9.1 R This section sets out the general obligation on _firms_ to monitor under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A the outcomes that _retail customers_ are\\nexperiencing from their _products_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.2 G The purpose of the monitoring obligation is to enable _firms_ to identify\\nwhether there are any risks that they are not meeting the requirements of\\nthe cross-cutting obligations and the _retail customer_ outcomes, and\\nconsequently they are not acting to deliver good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.3 G The frequency of monitoring, and the nature of the information a _firm_ must\\ncollect to effectively monitor the outcomes received by _retail customers_\\ndepends on the type of _firm_ and its role in the distribution chain, the nature\\nof the _product_, and the _target market_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.4 G (1) The monitoring obligation applies proportionately to a _firm’s_ role in\\nthe distribution chain.

This is in particular the effect of paragraphs (2)(f)\\nand (2)(g) of the definition of _retail customer_ .\\n\\n\\nObligations: Introduction\\n\\n\\n2.4.5 R (1) _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R exhaust what is required by _Rule_\\n6.\\n\\n\\n(2) Any reference in the _Handbook_ to the obligations on a member of a\\n_firm’s conduct rules staff_ under _Rule_ 6 is a reference to the\\nrequirements imposed by _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R.\\n\\n\\nObligations: Rules\\n\\n\\n2.4.6 R (1) You must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by\\nhonesty, fair and open dealing and acting consistently with the\\nreasonable expectations of _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.7 R You must avoid causing foreseeable harm to _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.8 R You must enable and support _retail customers_ to pursue their financial\\nobjectives.\\n\\n\\nReasonable application of Individual Conduct Rule 6\\n\\n\\n2.4.9 R The obligations in _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the standard\\nthat could reasonably be expected of a prudent _person_ subject to _COCON_ (as\\nset out in _COCON_ 1 (Application)):\\n\\n\\n(1) carrying on the same activity in relation to the same _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\nPage 62 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(2) taking appropriate account of the needs and characteristics of _retail_\\n_customers_ based on the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_\\nin the relevant target market or of individual _retail customers_ as the\\ncontext requires.\\n\\n\\nReferences to Principle 12\\n\\n\\n2.4.10 R Any reference in _COCON_ to _Principle_ 12 must be read in accordance with\\n_PRIN_ 2A.1.1R and _PRIN_ 2A.1.2R (Application) and _PRIN_ 2A.2.26R\\n(Interaction between Principle 12 and cross-cutting obligations).\\n\\n\\nAmend the following as shown.\\n\\n\\n**4** **Specific guidance on** ~~**individual**~~ **conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n**4.1** **Specific guidance on individual conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.1.18 G …\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relevance of\\nrules and guidance in PRIN\\n\\n\\n4.1.19 G The _guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2 (Cross-cutting obligations) will also be helpful\\nin interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.20 G (1) The _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2, insofar as not mirrored in _COCON_, will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus\\n_Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n(2) So for example, in line with _PRIN_ 2A.2.9R, in _COCON_ 2.4.7R:\\n\\n\\n(a) foreseeable harm may be caused by both act and omission;\\n\\n\\n(b) if the relationship of the _firm_ for which the relevant member\\nof its _conduct rules staff_ works with a _retail customer_ is\\nthrough its role in a distribution chain, foreseeable harm may\\nbe caused even where another _firm_ in that chain also\\ncontributes to the harm; and\\n\\n\\n(c) foreseeable harm may be caused even where another _person_\\nworking for the _firm_ is also responsible for or contributes to\\nthe harm.\\n\\n\\n4.1.21 G The outcomes _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.3 to _PRIN_ 2A.6 are also useful in defining\\nwhat is required by _Rule_ 6. However, the outcomes _rules_ do not exhaust\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.2 and so those _rules_ are not a comprehensive\\nguide to _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\nPage 63 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.22 G A reasonableness requirement applies to _Rule_ 6 (see _COCON_ 2.4.9R). The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility. This is particularly the case for _SMF_\\n_managers_ who are members of their _firm’s governing body_ or other senior\\n\\n_’_\\nmanagement forums and for other members of a _firm_ _s governing body_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.34 G On the other hand, the scope of the job of a junior staff member carrying out\\na back office function may not give much of an opportunity to take steps to\\nensure good outcomes for a _retail customer_ on the sale of a _product_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.35 G A salesperson or a member of the customer support staff is likely to have a\\nsignificant influence on the outcomes that a _retail customer_ receives. This is\\nthe case even if they are junior or subject to a detailed set of procedures.\\n\\n\\n**4.2** **Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nSC4: You must disclose appropriately any information of which the FCA or PRA\\nwould reasonably expect notice\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.2.30 G …\\n\\n\\n4.2.31 G The fact that the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_ works is under an\\nobligation to report something to the _FCA_ is relevant to the _SMF manager’s_\\nduties under SC4. So for example if the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_\\nworks is obliged by _PRIN_ 2A.9.17R to notify the _FCA_ that another _firm_ is not\\nor may not be complying with _Principle_ 12 or _PRIN_ 2A, the _SMF manager_\\nshould:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that the _firm_ reports that to the _FCA_ (or do so themselves) if\\nthe matter is within the scope of the _SMF manager’s_ responsibilities;\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\n(2) check whether the _firm_ has notified the matter if the matter is outside\\nthe responsibilities of the _SMF manager_ but the _SMF manager_ is\\nunable to assume that the _firm_ has notified it.\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 66 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex D**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the General Provisions (GEN)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text.\\n\\n\\n**2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**2.2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nGuidance applying while a firm has temporary permission\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n2.2.35A G A _TP firm_ should refer to the provisions listed below, which identify the _rules_\\nand _guidance_ in their sourcebooks that came into force after _IP completion day_\\nand in respect of which special provision has been made to apply them to _TP_\\n_firms_ .\\n\\n\\n_PRIN_ 3.1.13R,\\n\\n\\n_COBS_ 1.1.1CR,\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 67 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex E**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the Product Intervention and Product Governance sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text and striking through indicates deleted text.\\n\\n\\n**1** **Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**1.3** **Application of PROD 3**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nOther firms manufacturing or distributing financial instruments or structured\\ndeposits\\n\\n\\n1.3.2 R (1) Subject to (2) ~~Other~~ other _firms_ which _manufacture_ or _distribute_\\n_financial instruments_ or _structured deposits_ should take account of\\n_PROD_ 3 as if it were _guidance_ on the _Principles_ and other relevant _rules_\\nand as if “should” appeared in _PROD_ 3 rules instead of “must”.\\n\\n\\n(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a _firm_ to the extent that it is required to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12 (Consumer Duty) and _PRIN_ 2A in relation to\\na _product_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 68 of 68\\n\\n\\nPub ref: 007833\\n\\n\\n© Financial Conduct Authority 2022\\n12 Endeavour Square London E20 1JN\\nTelephone: +44 (0)20 7066 1000\\nWebsite: www.fca.org.uk\\nAll rights reserved</chunk>\")], [Document(metadata={'country': 'UK', 'source': 'FCA Consumer Duty Final Rules', '_id': '67c7d10a-60c9-41bd-94e4-85aa00281edb', '_collection_name': 'insurance-policies'}, page_content=\"<chunk_context>Annex 1 provides a comprehensive list of non-confidential respondents to the Consultation Paper CP21/36 regarding the new Consumer Duty proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ .

The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility.

In particular, it does not create a fiduciary\\nrelationship where one would not otherwise exist nor require a _firm_ to\\nprovide advice or carry out any other _regulated activity_ where it would not\\notherwise have done so.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.12 G The _FCA_ has issued guidance on the Consumer Duty in FG22/5, which\\n_firms_ should read alongside _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A as a guide to the\\n_FCA’s_ view as to how _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A might be complied with.\\n\\n\\nGuidance on responsibilities of firms in a product’s distribution chain\\n\\n\\n2A.1.13 G (1) _Principle_ 12 imposes obligations on _firms_ towards _retail customers_ of\\n_products_ irrespective of whether the customer is a _client_ of the _firm_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) This extended application aims to ensure the effectiveness of\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 which may properly relate to activities\\nwhich determine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes\\ncarried out by a _firm_ with whom the _retail customer_ is not in a _client_\\nrelationship.\\n\\n\\n(3) A _firm’s_ role in the distribution chain may mean it is unable to\\ndetermine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes in\\nconnection with the _product_ . If so, the _firm_ may not be subject to any\\nobligation under _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.14 G Obligations on _firms_ in the distribution chain of a _product_ must be\\ninterpreted reasonably, in a manner that reflects the _firm’s_ role in that\\n\\n\\nPage 14 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\ndistribution chain and the degree to which it can determine or materially\\ninfluence _retail customer_ outcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.15 G The extent of a _firm’s_ responsibilities under _Principle_ 12 in any one case\\nwill turn on the substance of the _firm’s_ role in the arrangements relating to\\nthe _product_ . A _firm_ which determines or has a material influence over _retail_\\n_customer_ outcomes is accountable notwithstanding that the _retail customer_\\nmay not be its _client_ due to the indirect nature of their relationship.\\n\\n\\nRelevance of guidance about Principles 6 and 7\\n\\n\\n2A.1.16 G Given the high-level nature and breadth of application of the _Principles_,\\nguidance about a _Principle_ cannot exhaustively cover its implications (see\\nalso _PRIN_ 1.1.9G).\\n\\n\\n2A.1.17 G (1) In general terms, _Principle_ 12 imposes a higher and more exacting\\nstandard of conduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_\\nrelative to what _Principles_ 6 or 7 would have otherwise required.\\n_Principle_ 12 also has a broader application in relation to a _firm’s_\\n_retail market business_ relative to _Principles_ 6 and 7, with a greater\\nfocus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_\\nrelationship with that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n(2) While existing, formal guidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 will remain\\nrelevant to _firms_ in considering their obligations under _Principle_ 12,\\n_firms_ should also take due account of the inherent limits of such\\nguidance in light of the factors in (1). See also _PRIN_ 2A.1.3G.\\n\\n\\n(3) To the extent that a _firm_ is not acting in accordance with existing\\nguidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 and the behaviour would amount to a\\nbreach of _Principle_ 6 or 7 in the event that they had continued to\\napply, the behaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n(4) Where a _firm_ is acting in accordance with guidance on _Principles_ 6\\nand 7 that should not be relied on alone in considering how to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12. _Firms_ also need to consider all their\\nobligations not only under the _Principles_, but under any other\\napplicable law, including other _FCA rules_ such as those expanding\\nupon _Principle_ 12 as set out in _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.18 G The effect of _PRIN_ 3.2.10R is that the application of _Principles_ 6 and 7 is\\nunchanged with respect to a _firm’s_ activities insofar as they are not subject\\nto _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n**2A.2** **Cross-cutting obligations**\\n\\n\\nAct in good faith\\n\\n\\n2A.2.1 R A _firm_ must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 15 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.2.2 R Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by honesty, fair\\nand open dealing and acting consistently with the reasonable expectations\\nof _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.2.3 G Examples of where a _firm_ is not acting in good faith would include:\\n\\n\\n(a) failing to take account of _retail customers’_ interests, for example in\\nthe way it designs a _product_ or presents information;\\n\\n\\n(b) seeking inappropriately to manipulate or exploit _retail customers_, for\\nexample by manipulating or exploiting their emotions or behavioural\\nbiases to mis-lead or create a demand for a _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(c) taking advantage of a _retail customer_ or their circumstances, for\\nexample any characteristics of vulnerability, in a manner which is\\nlikely to cause detriment;\\n\\n\\n(d) carrying out the same activity to a higher standard or more quickly\\nwhen it benefits the _firm_ than when it benefits the _retail customer_,\\nwithout objective justification.\\n\\n\\n2A.2.4 G Acting in good faith does not mean a _firm_ is prevented from pursuing\\nlegitimate commercial interests or seeking a profit, provided it does so in a\\nmanner which is compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ . Long-term products\\nwhere the outcome is not easy to predict, or non-standard\\ncharging structures, or other features which may not be easy\\nfor _retail customers_ to understand may require greater care\\nfrom a _firm_ to promote, monitor and support consumer\\nunderstanding;\\n\\n\\n(c) the costs, fees and charges involved with the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the relative utility to _retail customers_ of the _product_ as a\\nwhole and of specific features, options, or services within the\\n_product_, if subject to separate fees or charges;\\n\\n\\n(2) the characteristics of the _retail customer_ or _retail customers_\\nincluding (to the extent that a _firm_ either knows about or should\\nreasonably have known about them), in particular:\\n\\n\\n(a) their reasonable expectations in relation to the _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) their resources, degree of financial capability or\\nsophistication, characteristics of vulnerability and corporate\\nstructure (where relevant).\\n\\n\\n(3) the _firm’s_ role in relation to the _product_, including:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ . Acting\\nreasonably does not require a _firm_ to assume a fiduciary duty\\nor require an advisory service where it does not already exist;\\n\\n\\nPage 42 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(b) whether the _firm_ has provided or will provide advice to the\\n_retail customer_ . What is reasonable may be different where\\nadvice is being provided;\\n\\n\\n(c) the _firm’s_ role in the _product’s_ distribution chain, in particular\\nits role in determining or materially influencing outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ in relation to the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the stage in the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ .\\nThere will be times when _retail customers_ are particularly\\nexposed to harm, for example when they fall into arrears or\\nare considering long-term investment decisions. The actions a\\n_firm_ needs to take to be acting reasonably in such\\ncircumstances may be greater than when a _retail customer_ is\\nmaking decisions which carry a lesser risk of adverse\\n\\noutcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.7.3 G Acting in a way that could reasonably be expected of a prudent _firm_\\nrequires more than adopting a single solution that is reasonable. It includes\\n(among other things) considering whether the preferred solution provides\\ngood outcomes for all _retail customers_ affected or only some; and if only\\nsome, why it does not work for all, and how best to identify additional\\nactions which might mitigate the outcome for those adversely affected.\\n\\n\\nProtected characteristics and characteristics of vulnerability\\n\\n\\n2A.7.4 G In relation to the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_, a _firm_\\nshould, among other things:\\n\\n\\n(1) pay appropriate regard to the nature and scale of characteristics of\\nvulnerability that exist in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) pay appropriate regard to the impact of characteristics of vulnerability\\non the needs of _retail customers_ in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) when dealing with a particular _retail customer_ pay appropriate regard\\nto the needs and characteristics of that _retail customer_, such as\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability;\\n\\n\\n(4) assist frontline staff to understand how to actively identify\\ninformation that could indicate vulnerability and, where relevant,\\nseek information from _retail customers_ with characteristics of\\nvulnerability that will allow staff to respond to their needs; and\\n\\n\\n(5) set up systems and processes in a way that supports and enables _retail_\\n_customers_ with characteristics of vulnerability to disclose their needs.\\n\\n\\nPage 43 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.7.5 G (1) _Firms_ should be aware that groups of _retail customers_ with specific\\nprotected characteristics may have, or be more likely to have,\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability, for example older customers. In\\naddition, where health is a driver of vulnerability it will likely have\\nsubstantial overlap with the protected characteristic of ‘disability’\\nunder the Equality Act 2010. _Firms_ should be mindful of this when\\nconsidering whether they are compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_\\n2A and their obligations under the Equality Act 2010 or equivalent\\nlegislation.\\n\\n\\n(2) _Firms_ should keep themselves appraised of any evidence that may\\nemerge that _retail customers_ with specific protected characteristics\\nare more likely to have characteristics of vulnerability. _Firms_ should\\ntake account of any such evidence when considering whether they are\\ncompliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A and their obligations under\\nthe Equality Act 2010 or equivalent legislation.\\n\\n\\n**2A.8** **Governance and culture**\\n\\n\\nGovernance, strategy and policies\\n\\n\\n2A.8.1 R A _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that _Principle_ 12 and the obligations in this chapter are\\nreflected in their strategies, governance, leadership and people\\npolicies, including incentives at all levels; and\\n\\n\\n(2) ensure that _retail customer_ outcomes are a central focus of:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ risk control arrangements under _SYSC_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) the _firm’s_ internal audit function.\\n\\n\\nStaff incentives\\n\\n\\n2A.8.2 G A _firm_ should not use staff incentives, performance management or\\nremuneration structures in a way that conflicts with their obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A. _Firms_ should be aware that these structures are\\ncapable of causing harm to _retail customers_ and should design their\\nstructures in a way that is consistent with ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\nGoverning body report\\n\\n\\n2A.8.3 R A _firm_ must prepare a report for its governing body setting out the results\\nof its monitoring under _PRIN_ 2A.9 and any actions required as a result of\\nthe monitoring.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.4 R At least annually, the governing body of a _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\nPage 44 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(1) review and approve the _firm’s_ report on the outcomes being received\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) confirm whether it is satisfied that the _firm_ is complying with its\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A; and\\n\\n\\n(3) assess whether the _firm’s_ future business strategy is consistent with\\nits obligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.5 R When approving the _firm’s_ report under _PRIN_ 2A.8.4R(1), the governing\\nbody of the _firm_ must also agree:\\n\\n\\n(1) any action required to address any identified risk that _retail_\\n_customers_ may not receive good outcomes;\\n\\n\\n(2) any action required to address any identified instance where _retail_\\n_customers_ have not received good outcomes; and\\n\\n\\n(3) any amendments to the _firm’s_ business strategy to ensure that it\\nremains consistent with meeting the _firm’s_ obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n**2A.9** **Monitoring of consumer outcomes**\\n\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\n\\n2A.9.1 R This section sets out the general obligation on _firms_ to monitor under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A the outcomes that _retail customers_ are\\nexperiencing from their _products_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.2 G The purpose of the monitoring obligation is to enable _firms_ to identify\\nwhether there are any risks that they are not meeting the requirements of\\nthe cross-cutting obligations and the _retail customer_ outcomes, and\\nconsequently they are not acting to deliver good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.3 G The frequency of monitoring, and the nature of the information a _firm_ must\\ncollect to effectively monitor the outcomes received by _retail customers_\\ndepends on the type of _firm_ and its role in the distribution chain, the nature\\nof the _product_, and the _target market_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.4 G (1) The monitoring obligation applies proportionately to a _firm’s_ role in\\nthe distribution chain.

This is in particular the effect of paragraphs (2)(f)\\nand (2)(g) of the definition of _retail customer_ .\\n\\n\\nObligations: Introduction\\n\\n\\n2.4.5 R (1) _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R exhaust what is required by _Rule_\\n6.\\n\\n\\n(2) Any reference in the _Handbook_ to the obligations on a member of a\\n_firm’s conduct rules staff_ under _Rule_ 6 is a reference to the\\nrequirements imposed by _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R.\\n\\n\\nObligations: Rules\\n\\n\\n2.4.6 R (1) You must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by\\nhonesty, fair and open dealing and acting consistently with the\\nreasonable expectations of _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.7 R You must avoid causing foreseeable harm to _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.8 R You must enable and support _retail customers_ to pursue their financial\\nobjectives.\\n\\n\\nReasonable application of Individual Conduct Rule 6\\n\\n\\n2.4.9 R The obligations in _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the standard\\nthat could reasonably be expected of a prudent _person_ subject to _COCON_ (as\\nset out in _COCON_ 1 (Application)):\\n\\n\\n(1) carrying on the same activity in relation to the same _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\nPage 62 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(2) taking appropriate account of the needs and characteristics of _retail_\\n_customers_ based on the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_\\nin the relevant target market or of individual _retail customers_ as the\\ncontext requires.\\n\\n\\nReferences to Principle 12\\n\\n\\n2.4.10 R Any reference in _COCON_ to _Principle_ 12 must be read in accordance with\\n_PRIN_ 2A.1.1R and _PRIN_ 2A.1.2R (Application) and _PRIN_ 2A.2.26R\\n(Interaction between Principle 12 and cross-cutting obligations).\\n\\n\\nAmend the following as shown.\\n\\n\\n**4** **Specific guidance on** ~~**individual**~~ **conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n**4.1** **Specific guidance on individual conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.1.18 G …\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relevance of\\nrules and guidance in PRIN\\n\\n\\n4.1.19 G The _guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2 (Cross-cutting obligations) will also be helpful\\nin interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.20 G (1) The _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2, insofar as not mirrored in _COCON_, will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus\\n_Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n(2) So for example, in line with _PRIN_ 2A.2.9R, in _COCON_ 2.4.7R:\\n\\n\\n(a) foreseeable harm may be caused by both act and omission;\\n\\n\\n(b) if the relationship of the _firm_ for which the relevant member\\nof its _conduct rules staff_ works with a _retail customer_ is\\nthrough its role in a distribution chain, foreseeable harm may\\nbe caused even where another _firm_ in that chain also\\ncontributes to the harm; and\\n\\n\\n(c) foreseeable harm may be caused even where another _person_\\nworking for the _firm_ is also responsible for or contributes to\\nthe harm.\\n\\n\\n4.1.21 G The outcomes _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.3 to _PRIN_ 2A.6 are also useful in defining\\nwhat is required by _Rule_ 6. However, the outcomes _rules_ do not exhaust\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.2 and so those _rules_ are not a comprehensive\\nguide to _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\nPage 63 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.22 G A reasonableness requirement applies to _Rule_ 6 (see _COCON_ 2.4.9R). The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility. This is particularly the case for _SMF_\\n_managers_ who are members of their _firm’s governing body_ or other senior\\n\\n_’_\\nmanagement forums and for other members of a _firm_ _s governing body_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.34 G On the other hand, the scope of the job of a junior staff member carrying out\\na back office function may not give much of an opportunity to take steps to\\nensure good outcomes for a _retail customer_ on the sale of a _product_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.35 G A salesperson or a member of the customer support staff is likely to have a\\nsignificant influence on the outcomes that a _retail customer_ receives. This is\\nthe case even if they are junior or subject to a detailed set of procedures.\\n\\n\\n**4.2** **Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nSC4: You must disclose appropriately any information of which the FCA or PRA\\nwould reasonably expect notice\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.2.30 G …\\n\\n\\n4.2.31 G The fact that the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_ works is under an\\nobligation to report something to the _FCA_ is relevant to the _SMF manager’s_\\nduties under SC4. So for example if the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_\\nworks is obliged by _PRIN_ 2A.9.17R to notify the _FCA_ that another _firm_ is not\\nor may not be complying with _Principle_ 12 or _PRIN_ 2A, the _SMF manager_\\nshould:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that the _firm_ reports that to the _FCA_ (or do so themselves) if\\nthe matter is within the scope of the _SMF manager’s_ responsibilities;\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\n(2) check whether the _firm_ has notified the matter if the matter is outside\\nthe responsibilities of the _SMF manager_ but the _SMF manager_ is\\nunable to assume that the _firm_ has notified it.\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 66 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex D**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the General Provisions (GEN)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text.\\n\\n\\n**2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**2.2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nGuidance applying while a firm has temporary permission\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n2.2.35A G A _TP firm_ should refer to the provisions listed below, which identify the _rules_\\nand _guidance_ in their sourcebooks that came into force after _IP completion day_\\nand in respect of which special provision has been made to apply them to _TP_\\n_firms_ .\\n\\n\\n_PRIN_ 3.1.13R,\\n\\n\\n_COBS_ 1.1.1CR,\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 67 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex E**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the Product Intervention and Product Governance sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text and striking through indicates deleted text.\\n\\n\\n**1** **Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**1.3** **Application of PROD 3**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nOther firms manufacturing or distributing financial instruments or structured\\ndeposits\\n\\n\\n1.3.2 R (1) Subject to (2) ~~Other~~ other _firms_ which _manufacture_ or _distribute_\\n_financial instruments_ or _structured deposits_ should take account of\\n_PROD_ 3 as if it were _guidance_ on the _Principles_ and other relevant _rules_\\nand as if “should” appeared in _PROD_ 3 rules instead of “must”.\\n\\n\\n(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a _firm_ to the extent that it is required to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12 (Consumer Duty) and _PRIN_ 2A in relation to\\na _product_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 68 of 68\\n\\n\\nPub ref: 007833\\n\\n\\n© Financial Conduct Authority 2022\\n12 Endeavour Square London E20 1JN\\nTelephone: +44 (0)20 7066 1000\\nWebsite: www.fca.org.uk\\nAll rights reserved</chunk>\")], [Document(metadata={'country': 'UK', 'source': 'FCA Consumer Duty Final Rules', '_id': '67c7d10a-60c9-41bd-94e4-85aa00281edb', '_collection_name': 'insurance-policies'}, page_content=\"<chunk_context>Annex 1 provides a comprehensive list of non-confidential respondents to the Consultation Paper CP21/36 regarding the new Consumer Duty proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ .

The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility.

In particular, it does not create a fiduciary\\nrelationship where one would not otherwise exist nor require a _firm_ to\\nprovide advice or carry out any other _regulated activity_ where it would not\\notherwise have done so.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.12 G The _FCA_ has issued guidance on the Consumer Duty in FG22/5, which\\n_firms_ should read alongside _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A as a guide to the\\n_FCA’s_ view as to how _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A might be complied with.\\n\\n\\nGuidance on responsibilities of firms in a product’s distribution chain\\n\\n\\n2A.1.13 G (1) _Principle_ 12 imposes obligations on _firms_ towards _retail customers_ of\\n_products_ irrespective of whether the customer is a _client_ of the _firm_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) This extended application aims to ensure the effectiveness of\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 which may properly relate to activities\\nwhich determine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes\\ncarried out by a _firm_ with whom the _retail customer_ is not in a _client_\\nrelationship.\\n\\n\\n(3) A _firm’s_ role in the distribution chain may mean it is unable to\\ndetermine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes in\\nconnection with the _product_ . If so, the _firm_ may not be subject to any\\nobligation under _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.14 G Obligations on _firms_ in the distribution chain of a _product_ must be\\ninterpreted reasonably, in a manner that reflects the _firm’s_ role in that\\n\\n\\nPage 14 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\ndistribution chain and the degree to which it can determine or materially\\ninfluence _retail customer_ outcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.15 G The extent of a _firm’s_ responsibilities under _Principle_ 12 in any one case\\nwill turn on the substance of the _firm’s_ role in the arrangements relating to\\nthe _product_ . A _firm_ which determines or has a material influence over _retail_\\n_customer_ outcomes is accountable notwithstanding that the _retail customer_\\nmay not be its _client_ due to the indirect nature of their relationship.\\n\\n\\nRelevance of guidance about Principles 6 and 7\\n\\n\\n2A.1.16 G Given the high-level nature and breadth of application of the _Principles_,\\nguidance about a _Principle_ cannot exhaustively cover its implications (see\\nalso _PRIN_ 1.1.9G).\\n\\n\\n2A.1.17 G (1) In general terms, _Principle_ 12 imposes a higher and more exacting\\nstandard of conduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_\\nrelative to what _Principles_ 6 or 7 would have otherwise required.\\n_Principle_ 12 also has a broader application in relation to a _firm’s_\\n_retail market business_ relative to _Principles_ 6 and 7, with a greater\\nfocus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_\\nrelationship with that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n(2) While existing, formal guidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 will remain\\nrelevant to _firms_ in considering their obligations under _Principle_ 12,\\n_firms_ should also take due account of the inherent limits of such\\nguidance in light of the factors in (1). See also _PRIN_ 2A.1.3G.\\n\\n\\n(3) To the extent that a _firm_ is not acting in accordance with existing\\nguidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 and the behaviour would amount to a\\nbreach of _Principle_ 6 or 7 in the event that they had continued to\\napply, the behaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n(4) Where a _firm_ is acting in accordance with guidance on _Principles_ 6\\nand 7 that should not be relied on alone in considering how to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12. _Firms_ also need to consider all their\\nobligations not only under the _Principles_, but under any other\\napplicable law, including other _FCA rules_ such as those expanding\\nupon _Principle_ 12 as set out in _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.18 G The effect of _PRIN_ 3.2.10R is that the application of _Principles_ 6 and 7 is\\nunchanged with respect to a _firm’s_ activities insofar as they are not subject\\nto _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n**2A.2** **Cross-cutting obligations**\\n\\n\\nAct in good faith\\n\\n\\n2A.2.1 R A _firm_ must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 15 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.2.2 R Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by honesty, fair\\nand open dealing and acting consistently with the reasonable expectations\\nof _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.2.3 G Examples of where a _firm_ is not acting in good faith would include:\\n\\n\\n(a) failing to take account of _retail customers’_ interests, for example in\\nthe way it designs a _product_ or presents information;\\n\\n\\n(b) seeking inappropriately to manipulate or exploit _retail customers_, for\\nexample by manipulating or exploiting their emotions or behavioural\\nbiases to mis-lead or create a demand for a _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(c) taking advantage of a _retail customer_ or their circumstances, for\\nexample any characteristics of vulnerability, in a manner which is\\nlikely to cause detriment;\\n\\n\\n(d) carrying out the same activity to a higher standard or more quickly\\nwhen it benefits the _firm_ than when it benefits the _retail customer_,\\nwithout objective justification.\\n\\n\\n2A.2.4 G Acting in good faith does not mean a _firm_ is prevented from pursuing\\nlegitimate commercial interests or seeking a profit, provided it does so in a\\nmanner which is compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ . Long-term products\\nwhere the outcome is not easy to predict, or non-standard\\ncharging structures, or other features which may not be easy\\nfor _retail customers_ to understand may require greater care\\nfrom a _firm_ to promote, monitor and support consumer\\nunderstanding;\\n\\n\\n(c) the costs, fees and charges involved with the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the relative utility to _retail customers_ of the _product_ as a\\nwhole and of specific features, options, or services within the\\n_product_, if subject to separate fees or charges;\\n\\n\\n(2) the characteristics of the _retail customer_ or _retail customers_\\nincluding (to the extent that a _firm_ either knows about or should\\nreasonably have known about them), in particular:\\n\\n\\n(a) their reasonable expectations in relation to the _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) their resources, degree of financial capability or\\nsophistication, characteristics of vulnerability and corporate\\nstructure (where relevant).\\n\\n\\n(3) the _firm’s_ role in relation to the _product_, including:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ . Acting\\nreasonably does not require a _firm_ to assume a fiduciary duty\\nor require an advisory service where it does not already exist;\\n\\n\\nPage 42 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(b) whether the _firm_ has provided or will provide advice to the\\n_retail customer_ . What is reasonable may be different where\\nadvice is being provided;\\n\\n\\n(c) the _firm’s_ role in the _product’s_ distribution chain, in particular\\nits role in determining or materially influencing outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ in relation to the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the stage in the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ .\\nThere will be times when _retail customers_ are particularly\\nexposed to harm, for example when they fall into arrears or\\nare considering long-term investment decisions. The actions a\\n_firm_ needs to take to be acting reasonably in such\\ncircumstances may be greater than when a _retail customer_ is\\nmaking decisions which carry a lesser risk of adverse\\n\\noutcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.7.3 G Acting in a way that could reasonably be expected of a prudent _firm_\\nrequires more than adopting a single solution that is reasonable. It includes\\n(among other things) considering whether the preferred solution provides\\ngood outcomes for all _retail customers_ affected or only some; and if only\\nsome, why it does not work for all, and how best to identify additional\\nactions which might mitigate the outcome for those adversely affected.\\n\\n\\nProtected characteristics and characteristics of vulnerability\\n\\n\\n2A.7.4 G In relation to the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_, a _firm_\\nshould, among other things:\\n\\n\\n(1) pay appropriate regard to the nature and scale of characteristics of\\nvulnerability that exist in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) pay appropriate regard to the impact of characteristics of vulnerability\\non the needs of _retail customers_ in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) when dealing with a particular _retail customer_ pay appropriate regard\\nto the needs and characteristics of that _retail customer_, such as\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability;\\n\\n\\n(4) assist frontline staff to understand how to actively identify\\ninformation that could indicate vulnerability and, where relevant,\\nseek information from _retail customers_ with characteristics of\\nvulnerability that will allow staff to respond to their needs; and\\n\\n\\n(5) set up systems and processes in a way that supports and enables _retail_\\n_customers_ with characteristics of vulnerability to disclose their needs.\\n\\n\\nPage 43 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.7.5 G (1) _Firms_ should be aware that groups of _retail customers_ with specific\\nprotected characteristics may have, or be more likely to have,\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability, for example older customers. In\\naddition, where health is a driver of vulnerability it will likely have\\nsubstantial overlap with the protected characteristic of ‘disability’\\nunder the Equality Act 2010. _Firms_ should be mindful of this when\\nconsidering whether they are compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_\\n2A and their obligations under the Equality Act 2010 or equivalent\\nlegislation.\\n\\n\\n(2) _Firms_ should keep themselves appraised of any evidence that may\\nemerge that _retail customers_ with specific protected characteristics\\nare more likely to have characteristics of vulnerability. _Firms_ should\\ntake account of any such evidence when considering whether they are\\ncompliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A and their obligations under\\nthe Equality Act 2010 or equivalent legislation.\\n\\n\\n**2A.8** **Governance and culture**\\n\\n\\nGovernance, strategy and policies\\n\\n\\n2A.8.1 R A _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that _Principle_ 12 and the obligations in this chapter are\\nreflected in their strategies, governance, leadership and people\\npolicies, including incentives at all levels; and\\n\\n\\n(2) ensure that _retail customer_ outcomes are a central focus of:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ risk control arrangements under _SYSC_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) the _firm’s_ internal audit function.\\n\\n\\nStaff incentives\\n\\n\\n2A.8.2 G A _firm_ should not use staff incentives, performance management or\\nremuneration structures in a way that conflicts with their obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A. _Firms_ should be aware that these structures are\\ncapable of causing harm to _retail customers_ and should design their\\nstructures in a way that is consistent with ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\nGoverning body report\\n\\n\\n2A.8.3 R A _firm_ must prepare a report for its governing body setting out the results\\nof its monitoring under _PRIN_ 2A.9 and any actions required as a result of\\nthe monitoring.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.4 R At least annually, the governing body of a _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\nPage 44 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(1) review and approve the _firm’s_ report on the outcomes being received\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) confirm whether it is satisfied that the _firm_ is complying with its\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A; and\\n\\n\\n(3) assess whether the _firm’s_ future business strategy is consistent with\\nits obligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.5 R When approving the _firm’s_ report under _PRIN_ 2A.8.4R(1), the governing\\nbody of the _firm_ must also agree:\\n\\n\\n(1) any action required to address any identified risk that _retail_\\n_customers_ may not receive good outcomes;\\n\\n\\n(2) any action required to address any identified instance where _retail_\\n_customers_ have not received good outcomes; and\\n\\n\\n(3) any amendments to the _firm’s_ business strategy to ensure that it\\nremains consistent with meeting the _firm’s_ obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n**2A.9** **Monitoring of consumer outcomes**\\n\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\n\\n2A.9.1 R This section sets out the general obligation on _firms_ to monitor under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A the outcomes that _retail customers_ are\\nexperiencing from their _products_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.2 G The purpose of the monitoring obligation is to enable _firms_ to identify\\nwhether there are any risks that they are not meeting the requirements of\\nthe cross-cutting obligations and the _retail customer_ outcomes, and\\nconsequently they are not acting to deliver good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.3 G The frequency of monitoring, and the nature of the information a _firm_ must\\ncollect to effectively monitor the outcomes received by _retail customers_\\ndepends on the type of _firm_ and its role in the distribution chain, the nature\\nof the _product_, and the _target market_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.4 G (1) The monitoring obligation applies proportionately to a _firm’s_ role in\\nthe distribution chain.

This is in particular the effect of paragraphs (2)(f)\\nand (2)(g) of the definition of _retail customer_ .\\n\\n\\nObligations: Introduction\\n\\n\\n2.4.5 R (1) _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R exhaust what is required by _Rule_\\n6.\\n\\n\\n(2) Any reference in the _Handbook_ to the obligations on a member of a\\n_firm’s conduct rules staff_ under _Rule_ 6 is a reference to the\\nrequirements imposed by _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R.\\n\\n\\nObligations: Rules\\n\\n\\n2.4.6 R (1) You must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by\\nhonesty, fair and open dealing and acting consistently with the\\nreasonable expectations of _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.7 R You must avoid causing foreseeable harm to _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.8 R You must enable and support _retail customers_ to pursue their financial\\nobjectives.\\n\\n\\nReasonable application of Individual Conduct Rule 6\\n\\n\\n2.4.9 R The obligations in _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the standard\\nthat could reasonably be expected of a prudent _person_ subject to _COCON_ (as\\nset out in _COCON_ 1 (Application)):\\n\\n\\n(1) carrying on the same activity in relation to the same _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\nPage 62 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(2) taking appropriate account of the needs and characteristics of _retail_\\n_customers_ based on the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_\\nin the relevant target market or of individual _retail customers_ as the\\ncontext requires.\\n\\n\\nReferences to Principle 12\\n\\n\\n2.4.10 R Any reference in _COCON_ to _Principle_ 12 must be read in accordance with\\n_PRIN_ 2A.1.1R and _PRIN_ 2A.1.2R (Application) and _PRIN_ 2A.2.26R\\n(Interaction between Principle 12 and cross-cutting obligations).\\n\\n\\nAmend the following as shown.\\n\\n\\n**4** **Specific guidance on** ~~**individual**~~ **conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n**4.1** **Specific guidance on individual conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.1.18 G …\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relevance of\\nrules and guidance in PRIN\\n\\n\\n4.1.19 G The _guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2 (Cross-cutting obligations) will also be helpful\\nin interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.20 G (1) The _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2, insofar as not mirrored in _COCON_, will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus\\n_Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n(2) So for example, in line with _PRIN_ 2A.2.9R, in _COCON_ 2.4.7R:\\n\\n\\n(a) foreseeable harm may be caused by both act and omission;\\n\\n\\n(b) if the relationship of the _firm_ for which the relevant member\\nof its _conduct rules staff_ works with a _retail customer_ is\\nthrough its role in a distribution chain, foreseeable harm may\\nbe caused even where another _firm_ in that chain also\\ncontributes to the harm; and\\n\\n\\n(c) foreseeable harm may be caused even where another _person_\\nworking for the _firm_ is also responsible for or contributes to\\nthe harm.\\n\\n\\n4.1.21 G The outcomes _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.3 to _PRIN_ 2A.6 are also useful in defining\\nwhat is required by _Rule_ 6. However, the outcomes _rules_ do not exhaust\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.2 and so those _rules_ are not a comprehensive\\nguide to _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\nPage 63 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.22 G A reasonableness requirement applies to _Rule_ 6 (see _COCON_ 2.4.9R). The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility. This is particularly the case for _SMF_\\n_managers_ who are members of their _firm’s governing body_ or other senior\\n\\n_’_\\nmanagement forums and for other members of a _firm_ _s governing body_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.34 G On the other hand, the scope of the job of a junior staff member carrying out\\na back office function may not give much of an opportunity to take steps to\\nensure good outcomes for a _retail customer_ on the sale of a _product_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.35 G A salesperson or a member of the customer support staff is likely to have a\\nsignificant influence on the outcomes that a _retail customer_ receives. This is\\nthe case even if they are junior or subject to a detailed set of procedures.\\n\\n\\n**4.2** **Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nSC4: You must disclose appropriately any information of which the FCA or PRA\\nwould reasonably expect notice\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.2.30 G …\\n\\n\\n4.2.31 G The fact that the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_ works is under an\\nobligation to report something to the _FCA_ is relevant to the _SMF manager’s_\\nduties under SC4. So for example if the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_\\nworks is obliged by _PRIN_ 2A.9.17R to notify the _FCA_ that another _firm_ is not\\nor may not be complying with _Principle_ 12 or _PRIN_ 2A, the _SMF manager_\\nshould:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that the _firm_ reports that to the _FCA_ (or do so themselves) if\\nthe matter is within the scope of the _SMF manager’s_ responsibilities;\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\n(2) check whether the _firm_ has notified the matter if the matter is outside\\nthe responsibilities of the _SMF manager_ but the _SMF manager_ is\\nunable to assume that the _firm_ has notified it.\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 66 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex D**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the General Provisions (GEN)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text.\\n\\n\\n**2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**2.2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nGuidance applying while a firm has temporary permission\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n2.2.35A G A _TP firm_ should refer to the provisions listed below, which identify the _rules_\\nand _guidance_ in their sourcebooks that came into force after _IP completion day_\\nand in respect of which special provision has been made to apply them to _TP_\\n_firms_ .\\n\\n\\n_PRIN_ 3.1.13R,\\n\\n\\n_COBS_ 1.1.1CR,\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 67 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex E**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the Product Intervention and Product Governance sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text and striking through indicates deleted text.\\n\\n\\n**1** **Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**1.3** **Application of PROD 3**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nOther firms manufacturing or distributing financial instruments or structured\\ndeposits\\n\\n\\n1.3.2 R (1) Subject to (2) ~~Other~~ other _firms_ which _manufacture_ or _distribute_\\n_financial instruments_ or _structured deposits_ should take account of\\n_PROD_ 3 as if it were _guidance_ on the _Principles_ and other relevant _rules_\\nand as if “should” appeared in _PROD_ 3 rules instead of “must”.\\n\\n\\n(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a _firm_ to the extent that it is required to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12 (Consumer Duty) and _PRIN_ 2A in relation to\\na _product_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 68 of 68\\n\\n\\nPub ref: 007833\\n\\n\\n© Financial Conduct Authority 2022\\n12 Endeavour Square London E20 1JN\\nTelephone: +44 (0)20 7066 1000\\nWebsite: www.fca.org.uk\\nAll rights reserved</chunk>\")], [Document(metadata={'country': 'UK', 'source': 'FCA Consumer Duty Final Rules', '_id': '67c7d10a-60c9-41bd-94e4-85aa00281edb', '_collection_name': 'insurance-policies'}, page_content=\"<chunk_context>Annex 1 provides a comprehensive list of non-confidential respondents to the Consultation Paper CP21/36 regarding the new Consumer Duty proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ .

The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility.

In particular, it does not create a fiduciary\\nrelationship where one would not otherwise exist nor require a _firm_ to\\nprovide advice or carry out any other _regulated activity_ where it would not\\notherwise have done so.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.12 G The _FCA_ has issued guidance on the Consumer Duty in FG22/5, which\\n_firms_ should read alongside _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A as a guide to the\\n_FCA’s_ view as to how _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A might be complied with.\\n\\n\\nGuidance on responsibilities of firms in a product’s distribution chain\\n\\n\\n2A.1.13 G (1) _Principle_ 12 imposes obligations on _firms_ towards _retail customers_ of\\n_products_ irrespective of whether the customer is a _client_ of the _firm_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) This extended application aims to ensure the effectiveness of\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 which may properly relate to activities\\nwhich determine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes\\ncarried out by a _firm_ with whom the _retail customer_ is not in a _client_\\nrelationship.\\n\\n\\n(3) A _firm’s_ role in the distribution chain may mean it is unable to\\ndetermine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes in\\nconnection with the _product_ . If so, the _firm_ may not be subject to any\\nobligation under _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.14 G Obligations on _firms_ in the distribution chain of a _product_ must be\\ninterpreted reasonably, in a manner that reflects the _firm’s_ role in that\\n\\n\\nPage 14 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\ndistribution chain and the degree to which it can determine or materially\\ninfluence _retail customer_ outcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.15 G The extent of a _firm’s_ responsibilities under _Principle_ 12 in any one case\\nwill turn on the substance of the _firm’s_ role in the arrangements relating to\\nthe _product_ . A _firm_ which determines or has a material influence over _retail_\\n_customer_ outcomes is accountable notwithstanding that the _retail customer_\\nmay not be its _client_ due to the indirect nature of their relationship.\\n\\n\\nRelevance of guidance about Principles 6 and 7\\n\\n\\n2A.1.16 G Given the high-level nature and breadth of application of the _Principles_,\\nguidance about a _Principle_ cannot exhaustively cover its implications (see\\nalso _PRIN_ 1.1.9G).\\n\\n\\n2A.1.17 G (1) In general terms, _Principle_ 12 imposes a higher and more exacting\\nstandard of conduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_\\nrelative to what _Principles_ 6 or 7 would have otherwise required.\\n_Principle_ 12 also has a broader application in relation to a _firm’s_\\n_retail market business_ relative to _Principles_ 6 and 7, with a greater\\nfocus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_\\nrelationship with that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n(2) While existing, formal guidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 will remain\\nrelevant to _firms_ in considering their obligations under _Principle_ 12,\\n_firms_ should also take due account of the inherent limits of such\\nguidance in light of the factors in (1). See also _PRIN_ 2A.1.3G.\\n\\n\\n(3) To the extent that a _firm_ is not acting in accordance with existing\\nguidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 and the behaviour would amount to a\\nbreach of _Principle_ 6 or 7 in the event that they had continued to\\napply, the behaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n(4) Where a _firm_ is acting in accordance with guidance on _Principles_ 6\\nand 7 that should not be relied on alone in considering how to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12. _Firms_ also need to consider all their\\nobligations not only under the _Principles_, but under any other\\napplicable law, including other _FCA rules_ such as those expanding\\nupon _Principle_ 12 as set out in _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.18 G The effect of _PRIN_ 3.2.10R is that the application of _Principles_ 6 and 7 is\\nunchanged with respect to a _firm’s_ activities insofar as they are not subject\\nto _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n**2A.2** **Cross-cutting obligations**\\n\\n\\nAct in good faith\\n\\n\\n2A.2.1 R A _firm_ must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 15 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.2.2 R Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by honesty, fair\\nand open dealing and acting consistently with the reasonable expectations\\nof _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.2.3 G Examples of where a _firm_ is not acting in good faith would include:\\n\\n\\n(a) failing to take account of _retail customers’_ interests, for example in\\nthe way it designs a _product_ or presents information;\\n\\n\\n(b) seeking inappropriately to manipulate or exploit _retail customers_, for\\nexample by manipulating or exploiting their emotions or behavioural\\nbiases to mis-lead or create a demand for a _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(c) taking advantage of a _retail customer_ or their circumstances, for\\nexample any characteristics of vulnerability, in a manner which is\\nlikely to cause detriment;\\n\\n\\n(d) carrying out the same activity to a higher standard or more quickly\\nwhen it benefits the _firm_ than when it benefits the _retail customer_,\\nwithout objective justification.\\n\\n\\n2A.2.4 G Acting in good faith does not mean a _firm_ is prevented from pursuing\\nlegitimate commercial interests or seeking a profit, provided it does so in a\\nmanner which is compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ . Long-term products\\nwhere the outcome is not easy to predict, or non-standard\\ncharging structures, or other features which may not be easy\\nfor _retail customers_ to understand may require greater care\\nfrom a _firm_ to promote, monitor and support consumer\\nunderstanding;\\n\\n\\n(c) the costs, fees and charges involved with the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the relative utility to _retail customers_ of the _product_ as a\\nwhole and of specific features, options, or services within the\\n_product_, if subject to separate fees or charges;\\n\\n\\n(2) the characteristics of the _retail customer_ or _retail customers_\\nincluding (to the extent that a _firm_ either knows about or should\\nreasonably have known about them), in particular:\\n\\n\\n(a) their reasonable expectations in relation to the _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) their resources, degree of financial capability or\\nsophistication, characteristics of vulnerability and corporate\\nstructure (where relevant).\\n\\n\\n(3) the _firm’s_ role in relation to the _product_, including:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ . Acting\\nreasonably does not require a _firm_ to assume a fiduciary duty\\nor require an advisory service where it does not already exist;\\n\\n\\nPage 42 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(b) whether the _firm_ has provided or will provide advice to the\\n_retail customer_ . What is reasonable may be different where\\nadvice is being provided;\\n\\n\\n(c) the _firm’s_ role in the _product’s_ distribution chain, in particular\\nits role in determining or materially influencing outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ in relation to the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the stage in the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ .\\nThere will be times when _retail customers_ are particularly\\nexposed to harm, for example when they fall into arrears or\\nare considering long-term investment decisions. The actions a\\n_firm_ needs to take to be acting reasonably in such\\ncircumstances may be greater than when a _retail customer_ is\\nmaking decisions which carry a lesser risk of adverse\\n\\noutcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.7.3 G Acting in a way that could reasonably be expected of a prudent _firm_\\nrequires more than adopting a single solution that is reasonable. It includes\\n(among other things) considering whether the preferred solution provides\\ngood outcomes for all _retail customers_ affected or only some; and if only\\nsome, why it does not work for all, and how best to identify additional\\nactions which might mitigate the outcome for those adversely affected.\\n\\n\\nProtected characteristics and characteristics of vulnerability\\n\\n\\n2A.7.4 G In relation to the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_, a _firm_\\nshould, among other things:\\n\\n\\n(1) pay appropriate regard to the nature and scale of characteristics of\\nvulnerability that exist in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) pay appropriate regard to the impact of characteristics of vulnerability\\non the needs of _retail customers_ in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) when dealing with a particular _retail customer_ pay appropriate regard\\nto the needs and characteristics of that _retail customer_, such as\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability;\\n\\n\\n(4) assist frontline staff to understand how to actively identify\\ninformation that could indicate vulnerability and, where relevant,\\nseek information from _retail customers_ with characteristics of\\nvulnerability that will allow staff to respond to their needs; and\\n\\n\\n(5) set up systems and processes in a way that supports and enables _retail_\\n_customers_ with characteristics of vulnerability to disclose their needs.\\n\\n\\nPage 43 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.7.5 G (1) _Firms_ should be aware that groups of _retail customers_ with specific\\nprotected characteristics may have, or be more likely to have,\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability, for example older customers. In\\naddition, where health is a driver of vulnerability it will likely have\\nsubstantial overlap with the protected characteristic of ‘disability’\\nunder the Equality Act 2010. _Firms_ should be mindful of this when\\nconsidering whether they are compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_\\n2A and their obligations under the Equality Act 2010 or equivalent\\nlegislation.\\n\\n\\n(2) _Firms_ should keep themselves appraised of any evidence that may\\nemerge that _retail customers_ with specific protected characteristics\\nare more likely to have characteristics of vulnerability. _Firms_ should\\ntake account of any such evidence when considering whether they are\\ncompliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A and their obligations under\\nthe Equality Act 2010 or equivalent legislation.\\n\\n\\n**2A.8** **Governance and culture**\\n\\n\\nGovernance, strategy and policies\\n\\n\\n2A.8.1 R A _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that _Principle_ 12 and the obligations in this chapter are\\nreflected in their strategies, governance, leadership and people\\npolicies, including incentives at all levels; and\\n\\n\\n(2) ensure that _retail customer_ outcomes are a central focus of:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ risk control arrangements under _SYSC_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) the _firm’s_ internal audit function.\\n\\n\\nStaff incentives\\n\\n\\n2A.8.2 G A _firm_ should not use staff incentives, performance management or\\nremuneration structures in a way that conflicts with their obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A. _Firms_ should be aware that these structures are\\ncapable of causing harm to _retail customers_ and should design their\\nstructures in a way that is consistent with ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\nGoverning body report\\n\\n\\n2A.8.3 R A _firm_ must prepare a report for its governing body setting out the results\\nof its monitoring under _PRIN_ 2A.9 and any actions required as a result of\\nthe monitoring.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.4 R At least annually, the governing body of a _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\nPage 44 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(1) review and approve the _firm’s_ report on the outcomes being received\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) confirm whether it is satisfied that the _firm_ is complying with its\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A; and\\n\\n\\n(3) assess whether the _firm’s_ future business strategy is consistent with\\nits obligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.5 R When approving the _firm’s_ report under _PRIN_ 2A.8.4R(1), the governing\\nbody of the _firm_ must also agree:\\n\\n\\n(1) any action required to address any identified risk that _retail_\\n_customers_ may not receive good outcomes;\\n\\n\\n(2) any action required to address any identified instance where _retail_\\n_customers_ have not received good outcomes; and\\n\\n\\n(3) any amendments to the _firm’s_ business strategy to ensure that it\\nremains consistent with meeting the _firm’s_ obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n**2A.9** **Monitoring of consumer outcomes**\\n\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\n\\n2A.9.1 R This section sets out the general obligation on _firms_ to monitor under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A the outcomes that _retail customers_ are\\nexperiencing from their _products_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.2 G The purpose of the monitoring obligation is to enable _firms_ to identify\\nwhether there are any risks that they are not meeting the requirements of\\nthe cross-cutting obligations and the _retail customer_ outcomes, and\\nconsequently they are not acting to deliver good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.3 G The frequency of monitoring, and the nature of the information a _firm_ must\\ncollect to effectively monitor the outcomes received by _retail customers_\\ndepends on the type of _firm_ and its role in the distribution chain, the nature\\nof the _product_, and the _target market_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.4 G (1) The monitoring obligation applies proportionately to a _firm’s_ role in\\nthe distribution chain.

This is in particular the effect of paragraphs (2)(f)\\nand (2)(g) of the definition of _retail customer_ .\\n\\n\\nObligations: Introduction\\n\\n\\n2.4.5 R (1) _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R exhaust what is required by _Rule_\\n6.\\n\\n\\n(2) Any reference in the _Handbook_ to the obligations on a member of a\\n_firm’s conduct rules staff_ under _Rule_ 6 is a reference to the\\nrequirements imposed by _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R.\\n\\n\\nObligations: Rules\\n\\n\\n2.4.6 R (1) You must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by\\nhonesty, fair and open dealing and acting consistently with the\\nreasonable expectations of _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.7 R You must avoid causing foreseeable harm to _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.8 R You must enable and support _retail customers_ to pursue their financial\\nobjectives.\\n\\n\\nReasonable application of Individual Conduct Rule 6\\n\\n\\n2.4.9 R The obligations in _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the standard\\nthat could reasonably be expected of a prudent _person_ subject to _COCON_ (as\\nset out in _COCON_ 1 (Application)):\\n\\n\\n(1) carrying on the same activity in relation to the same _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\nPage 62 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(2) taking appropriate account of the needs and characteristics of _retail_\\n_customers_ based on the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_\\nin the relevant target market or of individual _retail customers_ as the\\ncontext requires.\\n\\n\\nReferences to Principle 12\\n\\n\\n2.4.10 R Any reference in _COCON_ to _Principle_ 12 must be read in accordance with\\n_PRIN_ 2A.1.1R and _PRIN_ 2A.1.2R (Application) and _PRIN_ 2A.2.26R\\n(Interaction between Principle 12 and cross-cutting obligations).\\n\\n\\nAmend the following as shown.\\n\\n\\n**4** **Specific guidance on** ~~**individual**~~ **conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n**4.1** **Specific guidance on individual conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.1.18 G …\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relevance of\\nrules and guidance in PRIN\\n\\n\\n4.1.19 G The _guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2 (Cross-cutting obligations) will also be helpful\\nin interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.20 G (1) The _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2, insofar as not mirrored in _COCON_, will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus\\n_Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n(2) So for example, in line with _PRIN_ 2A.2.9R, in _COCON_ 2.4.7R:\\n\\n\\n(a) foreseeable harm may be caused by both act and omission;\\n\\n\\n(b) if the relationship of the _firm_ for which the relevant member\\nof its _conduct rules staff_ works with a _retail customer_ is\\nthrough its role in a distribution chain, foreseeable harm may\\nbe caused even where another _firm_ in that chain also\\ncontributes to the harm; and\\n\\n\\n(c) foreseeable harm may be caused even where another _person_\\nworking for the _firm_ is also responsible for or contributes to\\nthe harm.\\n\\n\\n4.1.21 G The outcomes _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.3 to _PRIN_ 2A.6 are also useful in defining\\nwhat is required by _Rule_ 6. However, the outcomes _rules_ do not exhaust\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.2 and so those _rules_ are not a comprehensive\\nguide to _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\nPage 63 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.22 G A reasonableness requirement applies to _Rule_ 6 (see _COCON_ 2.4.9R). The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility. This is particularly the case for _SMF_\\n_managers_ who are members of their _firm’s governing body_ or other senior\\n\\n_’_\\nmanagement forums and for other members of a _firm_ _s governing body_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.34 G On the other hand, the scope of the job of a junior staff member carrying out\\na back office function may not give much of an opportunity to take steps to\\nensure good outcomes for a _retail customer_ on the sale of a _product_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.35 G A salesperson or a member of the customer support staff is likely to have a\\nsignificant influence on the outcomes that a _retail customer_ receives. This is\\nthe case even if they are junior or subject to a detailed set of procedures.\\n\\n\\n**4.2** **Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nSC4: You must disclose appropriately any information of which the FCA or PRA\\nwould reasonably expect notice\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.2.30 G …\\n\\n\\n4.2.31 G The fact that the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_ works is under an\\nobligation to report something to the _FCA_ is relevant to the _SMF manager’s_\\nduties under SC4. So for example if the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_\\nworks is obliged by _PRIN_ 2A.9.17R to notify the _FCA_ that another _firm_ is not\\nor may not be complying with _Principle_ 12 or _PRIN_ 2A, the _SMF manager_\\nshould:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that the _firm_ reports that to the _FCA_ (or do so themselves) if\\nthe matter is within the scope of the _SMF manager’s_ responsibilities;\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\n(2) check whether the _firm_ has notified the matter if the matter is outside\\nthe responsibilities of the _SMF manager_ but the _SMF manager_ is\\nunable to assume that the _firm_ has notified it.\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 66 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex D**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the General Provisions (GEN)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text.\\n\\n\\n**2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**2.2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nGuidance applying while a firm has temporary permission\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n2.2.35A G A _TP firm_ should refer to the provisions listed below, which identify the _rules_\\nand _guidance_ in their sourcebooks that came into force after _IP completion day_\\nand in respect of which special provision has been made to apply them to _TP_\\n_firms_ .\\n\\n\\n_PRIN_ 3.1.13R,\\n\\n\\n_COBS_ 1.1.1CR,\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 67 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex E**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the Product Intervention and Product Governance sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text and striking through indicates deleted text.\\n\\n\\n**1** **Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**1.3** **Application of PROD 3**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nOther firms manufacturing or distributing financial instruments or structured\\ndeposits\\n\\n\\n1.3.2 R (1) Subject to (2) ~~Other~~ other _firms_ which _manufacture_ or _distribute_\\n_financial instruments_ or _structured deposits_ should take account of\\n_PROD_ 3 as if it were _guidance_ on the _Principles_ and other relevant _rules_\\nand as if “should” appeared in _PROD_ 3 rules instead of “must”.\\n\\n\\n(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a _firm_ to the extent that it is required to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12 (Consumer Duty) and _PRIN_ 2A in relation to\\na _product_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 68 of 68\\n\\n\\nPub ref: 007833\\n\\n\\n© Financial Conduct Authority 2022\\n12 Endeavour Square London E20 1JN\\nTelephone: +44 (0)20 7066 1000\\nWebsite: www.fca.org.uk\\nAll rights reserved</chunk>\")], [Document(metadata={'country': 'UK', 'source': 'FCA Consumer Duty Final Rules', '_id': '67c7d10a-60c9-41bd-94e4-85aa00281edb', '_collection_name': 'insurance-policies'}, page_content=\"<chunk_context>Annex 1 provides a comprehensive list of non-confidential respondents to the Consultation Paper CP21/36 regarding the new Consumer Duty proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ .

The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility.

In particular, it does not create a fiduciary\\nrelationship where one would not otherwise exist nor require a _firm_ to\\nprovide advice or carry out any other _regulated activity_ where it would not\\notherwise have done so.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.12 G The _FCA_ has issued guidance on the Consumer Duty in FG22/5, which\\n_firms_ should read alongside _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A as a guide to the\\n_FCA’s_ view as to how _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A might be complied with.\\n\\n\\nGuidance on responsibilities of firms in a product’s distribution chain\\n\\n\\n2A.1.13 G (1) _Principle_ 12 imposes obligations on _firms_ towards _retail customers_ of\\n_products_ irrespective of whether the customer is a _client_ of the _firm_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) This extended application aims to ensure the effectiveness of\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 which may properly relate to activities\\nwhich determine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes\\ncarried out by a _firm_ with whom the _retail customer_ is not in a _client_\\nrelationship.\\n\\n\\n(3) A _firm’s_ role in the distribution chain may mean it is unable to\\ndetermine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes in\\nconnection with the _product_ . If so, the _firm_ may not be subject to any\\nobligation under _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.14 G Obligations on _firms_ in the distribution chain of a _product_ must be\\ninterpreted reasonably, in a manner that reflects the _firm’s_ role in that\\n\\n\\nPage 14 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\ndistribution chain and the degree to which it can determine or materially\\ninfluence _retail customer_ outcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.15 G The extent of a _firm’s_ responsibilities under _Principle_ 12 in any one case\\nwill turn on the substance of the _firm’s_ role in the arrangements relating to\\nthe _product_ . A _firm_ which determines or has a material influence over _retail_\\n_customer_ outcomes is accountable notwithstanding that the _retail customer_\\nmay not be its _client_ due to the indirect nature of their relationship.\\n\\n\\nRelevance of guidance about Principles 6 and 7\\n\\n\\n2A.1.16 G Given the high-level nature and breadth of application of the _Principles_,\\nguidance about a _Principle_ cannot exhaustively cover its implications (see\\nalso _PRIN_ 1.1.9G).\\n\\n\\n2A.1.17 G (1) In general terms, _Principle_ 12 imposes a higher and more exacting\\nstandard of conduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_\\nrelative to what _Principles_ 6 or 7 would have otherwise required.\\n_Principle_ 12 also has a broader application in relation to a _firm’s_\\n_retail market business_ relative to _Principles_ 6 and 7, with a greater\\nfocus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_\\nrelationship with that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n(2) While existing, formal guidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 will remain\\nrelevant to _firms_ in considering their obligations under _Principle_ 12,\\n_firms_ should also take due account of the inherent limits of such\\nguidance in light of the factors in (1). See also _PRIN_ 2A.1.3G.\\n\\n\\n(3) To the extent that a _firm_ is not acting in accordance with existing\\nguidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 and the behaviour would amount to a\\nbreach of _Principle_ 6 or 7 in the event that they had continued to\\napply, the behaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n(4) Where a _firm_ is acting in accordance with guidance on _Principles_ 6\\nand 7 that should not be relied on alone in considering how to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12. _Firms_ also need to consider all their\\nobligations not only under the _Principles_, but under any other\\napplicable law, including other _FCA rules_ such as those expanding\\nupon _Principle_ 12 as set out in _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.18 G The effect of _PRIN_ 3.2.10R is that the application of _Principles_ 6 and 7 is\\nunchanged with respect to a _firm’s_ activities insofar as they are not subject\\nto _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n**2A.2** **Cross-cutting obligations**\\n\\n\\nAct in good faith\\n\\n\\n2A.2.1 R A _firm_ must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 15 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.2.2 R Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by honesty, fair\\nand open dealing and acting consistently with the reasonable expectations\\nof _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.2.3 G Examples of where a _firm_ is not acting in good faith would include:\\n\\n\\n(a) failing to take account of _retail customers’_ interests, for example in\\nthe way it designs a _product_ or presents information;\\n\\n\\n(b) seeking inappropriately to manipulate or exploit _retail customers_, for\\nexample by manipulating or exploiting their emotions or behavioural\\nbiases to mis-lead or create a demand for a _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(c) taking advantage of a _retail customer_ or their circumstances, for\\nexample any characteristics of vulnerability, in a manner which is\\nlikely to cause detriment;\\n\\n\\n(d) carrying out the same activity to a higher standard or more quickly\\nwhen it benefits the _firm_ than when it benefits the _retail customer_,\\nwithout objective justification.\\n\\n\\n2A.2.4 G Acting in good faith does not mean a _firm_ is prevented from pursuing\\nlegitimate commercial interests or seeking a profit, provided it does so in a\\nmanner which is compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ . Long-term products\\nwhere the outcome is not easy to predict, or non-standard\\ncharging structures, or other features which may not be easy\\nfor _retail customers_ to understand may require greater care\\nfrom a _firm_ to promote, monitor and support consumer\\nunderstanding;\\n\\n\\n(c) the costs, fees and charges involved with the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the relative utility to _retail customers_ of the _product_ as a\\nwhole and of specific features, options, or services within the\\n_product_, if subject to separate fees or charges;\\n\\n\\n(2) the characteristics of the _retail customer_ or _retail customers_\\nincluding (to the extent that a _firm_ either knows about or should\\nreasonably have known about them), in particular:\\n\\n\\n(a) their reasonable expectations in relation to the _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) their resources, degree of financial capability or\\nsophistication, characteristics of vulnerability and corporate\\nstructure (where relevant).\\n\\n\\n(3) the _firm’s_ role in relation to the _product_, including:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ . Acting\\nreasonably does not require a _firm_ to assume a fiduciary duty\\nor require an advisory service where it does not already exist;\\n\\n\\nPage 42 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(b) whether the _firm_ has provided or will provide advice to the\\n_retail customer_ . What is reasonable may be different where\\nadvice is being provided;\\n\\n\\n(c) the _firm’s_ role in the _product’s_ distribution chain, in particular\\nits role in determining or materially influencing outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ in relation to the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the stage in the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ .\\nThere will be times when _retail customers_ are particularly\\nexposed to harm, for example when they fall into arrears or\\nare considering long-term investment decisions. The actions a\\n_firm_ needs to take to be acting reasonably in such\\ncircumstances may be greater than when a _retail customer_ is\\nmaking decisions which carry a lesser risk of adverse\\n\\noutcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.7.3 G Acting in a way that could reasonably be expected of a prudent _firm_\\nrequires more than adopting a single solution that is reasonable. It includes\\n(among other things) considering whether the preferred solution provides\\ngood outcomes for all _retail customers_ affected or only some; and if only\\nsome, why it does not work for all, and how best to identify additional\\nactions which might mitigate the outcome for those adversely affected.\\n\\n\\nProtected characteristics and characteristics of vulnerability\\n\\n\\n2A.7.4 G In relation to the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_, a _firm_\\nshould, among other things:\\n\\n\\n(1) pay appropriate regard to the nature and scale of characteristics of\\nvulnerability that exist in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) pay appropriate regard to the impact of characteristics of vulnerability\\non the needs of _retail customers_ in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) when dealing with a particular _retail customer_ pay appropriate regard\\nto the needs and characteristics of that _retail customer_, such as\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability;\\n\\n\\n(4) assist frontline staff to understand how to actively identify\\ninformation that could indicate vulnerability and, where relevant,\\nseek information from _retail customers_ with characteristics of\\nvulnerability that will allow staff to respond to their needs; and\\n\\n\\n(5) set up systems and processes in a way that supports and enables _retail_\\n_customers_ with characteristics of vulnerability to disclose their needs.\\n\\n\\nPage 43 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.7.5 G (1) _Firms_ should be aware that groups of _retail customers_ with specific\\nprotected characteristics may have, or be more likely to have,\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability, for example older customers. In\\naddition, where health is a driver of vulnerability it will likely have\\nsubstantial overlap with the protected characteristic of ‘disability’\\nunder the Equality Act 2010. _Firms_ should be mindful of this when\\nconsidering whether they are compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_\\n2A and their obligations under the Equality Act 2010 or equivalent\\nlegislation.\\n\\n\\n(2) _Firms_ should keep themselves appraised of any evidence that may\\nemerge that _retail customers_ with specific protected characteristics\\nare more likely to have characteristics of vulnerability. _Firms_ should\\ntake account of any such evidence when considering whether they are\\ncompliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A and their obligations under\\nthe Equality Act 2010 or equivalent legislation.\\n\\n\\n**2A.8** **Governance and culture**\\n\\n\\nGovernance, strategy and policies\\n\\n\\n2A.8.1 R A _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that _Principle_ 12 and the obligations in this chapter are\\nreflected in their strategies, governance, leadership and people\\npolicies, including incentives at all levels; and\\n\\n\\n(2) ensure that _retail customer_ outcomes are a central focus of:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ risk control arrangements under _SYSC_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) the _firm’s_ internal audit function.\\n\\n\\nStaff incentives\\n\\n\\n2A.8.2 G A _firm_ should not use staff incentives, performance management or\\nremuneration structures in a way that conflicts with their obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A. _Firms_ should be aware that these structures are\\ncapable of causing harm to _retail customers_ and should design their\\nstructures in a way that is consistent with ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\nGoverning body report\\n\\n\\n2A.8.3 R A _firm_ must prepare a report for its governing body setting out the results\\nof its monitoring under _PRIN_ 2A.9 and any actions required as a result of\\nthe monitoring.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.4 R At least annually, the governing body of a _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\nPage 44 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(1) review and approve the _firm’s_ report on the outcomes being received\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) confirm whether it is satisfied that the _firm_ is complying with its\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A; and\\n\\n\\n(3) assess whether the _firm’s_ future business strategy is consistent with\\nits obligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.5 R When approving the _firm’s_ report under _PRIN_ 2A.8.4R(1), the governing\\nbody of the _firm_ must also agree:\\n\\n\\n(1) any action required to address any identified risk that _retail_\\n_customers_ may not receive good outcomes;\\n\\n\\n(2) any action required to address any identified instance where _retail_\\n_customers_ have not received good outcomes; and\\n\\n\\n(3) any amendments to the _firm’s_ business strategy to ensure that it\\nremains consistent with meeting the _firm’s_ obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n**2A.9** **Monitoring of consumer outcomes**\\n\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\n\\n2A.9.1 R This section sets out the general obligation on _firms_ to monitor under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A the outcomes that _retail customers_ are\\nexperiencing from their _products_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.2 G The purpose of the monitoring obligation is to enable _firms_ to identify\\nwhether there are any risks that they are not meeting the requirements of\\nthe cross-cutting obligations and the _retail customer_ outcomes, and\\nconsequently they are not acting to deliver good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.3 G The frequency of monitoring, and the nature of the information a _firm_ must\\ncollect to effectively monitor the outcomes received by _retail customers_\\ndepends on the type of _firm_ and its role in the distribution chain, the nature\\nof the _product_, and the _target market_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.4 G (1) The monitoring obligation applies proportionately to a _firm’s_ role in\\nthe distribution chain.

This is in particular the effect of paragraphs (2)(f)\\nand (2)(g) of the definition of _retail customer_ .\\n\\n\\nObligations: Introduction\\n\\n\\n2.4.5 R (1) _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R exhaust what is required by _Rule_\\n6.\\n\\n\\n(2) Any reference in the _Handbook_ to the obligations on a member of a\\n_firm’s conduct rules staff_ under _Rule_ 6 is a reference to the\\nrequirements imposed by _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R.\\n\\n\\nObligations: Rules\\n\\n\\n2.4.6 R (1) You must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by\\nhonesty, fair and open dealing and acting consistently with the\\nreasonable expectations of _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.7 R You must avoid causing foreseeable harm to _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.8 R You must enable and support _retail customers_ to pursue their financial\\nobjectives.\\n\\n\\nReasonable application of Individual Conduct Rule 6\\n\\n\\n2.4.9 R The obligations in _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the standard\\nthat could reasonably be expected of a prudent _person_ subject to _COCON_ (as\\nset out in _COCON_ 1 (Application)):\\n\\n\\n(1) carrying on the same activity in relation to the same _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\nPage 62 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(2) taking appropriate account of the needs and characteristics of _retail_\\n_customers_ based on the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_\\nin the relevant target market or of individual _retail customers_ as the\\ncontext requires.\\n\\n\\nReferences to Principle 12\\n\\n\\n2.4.10 R Any reference in _COCON_ to _Principle_ 12 must be read in accordance with\\n_PRIN_ 2A.1.1R and _PRIN_ 2A.1.2R (Application) and _PRIN_ 2A.2.26R\\n(Interaction between Principle 12 and cross-cutting obligations).\\n\\n\\nAmend the following as shown.\\n\\n\\n**4** **Specific guidance on** ~~**individual**~~ **conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n**4.1** **Specific guidance on individual conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.1.18 G …\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relevance of\\nrules and guidance in PRIN\\n\\n\\n4.1.19 G The _guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2 (Cross-cutting obligations) will also be helpful\\nin interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.20 G (1) The _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2, insofar as not mirrored in _COCON_, will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus\\n_Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n(2) So for example, in line with _PRIN_ 2A.2.9R, in _COCON_ 2.4.7R:\\n\\n\\n(a) foreseeable harm may be caused by both act and omission;\\n\\n\\n(b) if the relationship of the _firm_ for which the relevant member\\nof its _conduct rules staff_ works with a _retail customer_ is\\nthrough its role in a distribution chain, foreseeable harm may\\nbe caused even where another _firm_ in that chain also\\ncontributes to the harm; and\\n\\n\\n(c) foreseeable harm may be caused even where another _person_\\nworking for the _firm_ is also responsible for or contributes to\\nthe harm.\\n\\n\\n4.1.21 G The outcomes _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.3 to _PRIN_ 2A.6 are also useful in defining\\nwhat is required by _Rule_ 6. However, the outcomes _rules_ do not exhaust\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.2 and so those _rules_ are not a comprehensive\\nguide to _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\nPage 63 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.22 G A reasonableness requirement applies to _Rule_ 6 (see _COCON_ 2.4.9R). The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility. This is particularly the case for _SMF_\\n_managers_ who are members of their _firm’s governing body_ or other senior\\n\\n_’_\\nmanagement forums and for other members of a _firm_ _s governing body_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.34 G On the other hand, the scope of the job of a junior staff member carrying out\\na back office function may not give much of an opportunity to take steps to\\nensure good outcomes for a _retail customer_ on the sale of a _product_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.35 G A salesperson or a member of the customer support staff is likely to have a\\nsignificant influence on the outcomes that a _retail customer_ receives. This is\\nthe case even if they are junior or subject to a detailed set of procedures.\\n\\n\\n**4.2** **Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nSC4: You must disclose appropriately any information of which the FCA or PRA\\nwould reasonably expect notice\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.2.30 G …\\n\\n\\n4.2.31 G The fact that the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_ works is under an\\nobligation to report something to the _FCA_ is relevant to the _SMF manager’s_\\nduties under SC4. So for example if the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_\\nworks is obliged by _PRIN_ 2A.9.17R to notify the _FCA_ that another _firm_ is not\\nor may not be complying with _Principle_ 12 or _PRIN_ 2A, the _SMF manager_\\nshould:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that the _firm_ reports that to the _FCA_ (or do so themselves) if\\nthe matter is within the scope of the _SMF manager’s_ responsibilities;\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\n(2) check whether the _firm_ has notified the matter if the matter is outside\\nthe responsibilities of the _SMF manager_ but the _SMF manager_ is\\nunable to assume that the _firm_ has notified it.\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 66 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex D**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the General Provisions (GEN)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text.\\n\\n\\n**2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**2.2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nGuidance applying while a firm has temporary permission\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n2.2.35A G A _TP firm_ should refer to the provisions listed below, which identify the _rules_\\nand _guidance_ in their sourcebooks that came into force after _IP completion day_\\nand in respect of which special provision has been made to apply them to _TP_\\n_firms_ .\\n\\n\\n_PRIN_ 3.1.13R,\\n\\n\\n_COBS_ 1.1.1CR,\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 67 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex E**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the Product Intervention and Product Governance sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text and striking through indicates deleted text.\\n\\n\\n**1** **Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**1.3** **Application of PROD 3**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nOther firms manufacturing or distributing financial instruments or structured\\ndeposits\\n\\n\\n1.3.2 R (1) Subject to (2) ~~Other~~ other _firms_ which _manufacture_ or _distribute_\\n_financial instruments_ or _structured deposits_ should take account of\\n_PROD_ 3 as if it were _guidance_ on the _Principles_ and other relevant _rules_\\nand as if “should” appeared in _PROD_ 3 rules instead of “must”.\\n\\n\\n(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a _firm_ to the extent that it is required to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12 (Consumer Duty) and _PRIN_ 2A in relation to\\na _product_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 68 of 68\\n\\n\\nPub ref: 007833\\n\\n\\n© Financial Conduct Authority 2022\\n12 Endeavour Square London E20 1JN\\nTelephone: +44 (0)20 7066 1000\\nWebsite: www.fca.org.uk\\nAll rights reserved</chunk>\")], [Document(metadata={'country': 'UK', 'source': 'FCA Consumer Duty Final Rules', '_id': '67c7d10a-60c9-41bd-94e4-85aa00281edb', '_collection_name': 'insurance-policies'}, page_content=\"<chunk_context>Annex 1 provides a comprehensive list of non-confidential respondents to the Consultation Paper CP21/36 regarding the new Consumer Duty proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ .

The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility.

In particular, it does not create a fiduciary\\nrelationship where one would not otherwise exist nor require a _firm_ to\\nprovide advice or carry out any other _regulated activity_ where it would not\\notherwise have done so.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.12 G The _FCA_ has issued guidance on the Consumer Duty in FG22/5, which\\n_firms_ should read alongside _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A as a guide to the\\n_FCA’s_ view as to how _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A might be complied with.\\n\\n\\nGuidance on responsibilities of firms in a product’s distribution chain\\n\\n\\n2A.1.13 G (1) _Principle_ 12 imposes obligations on _firms_ towards _retail customers_ of\\n_products_ irrespective of whether the customer is a _client_ of the _firm_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) This extended application aims to ensure the effectiveness of\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 which may properly relate to activities\\nwhich determine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes\\ncarried out by a _firm_ with whom the _retail customer_ is not in a _client_\\nrelationship.\\n\\n\\n(3) A _firm’s_ role in the distribution chain may mean it is unable to\\ndetermine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes in\\nconnection with the _product_ . If so, the _firm_ may not be subject to any\\nobligation under _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.14 G Obligations on _firms_ in the distribution chain of a _product_ must be\\ninterpreted reasonably, in a manner that reflects the _firm’s_ role in that\\n\\n\\nPage 14 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\ndistribution chain and the degree to which it can determine or materially\\ninfluence _retail customer_ outcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.15 G The extent of a _firm’s_ responsibilities under _Principle_ 12 in any one case\\nwill turn on the substance of the _firm’s_ role in the arrangements relating to\\nthe _product_ . A _firm_ which determines or has a material influence over _retail_\\n_customer_ outcomes is accountable notwithstanding that the _retail customer_\\nmay not be its _client_ due to the indirect nature of their relationship.\\n\\n\\nRelevance of guidance about Principles 6 and 7\\n\\n\\n2A.1.16 G Given the high-level nature and breadth of application of the _Principles_,\\nguidance about a _Principle_ cannot exhaustively cover its implications (see\\nalso _PRIN_ 1.1.9G).\\n\\n\\n2A.1.17 G (1) In general terms, _Principle_ 12 imposes a higher and more exacting\\nstandard of conduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_\\nrelative to what _Principles_ 6 or 7 would have otherwise required.\\n_Principle_ 12 also has a broader application in relation to a _firm’s_\\n_retail market business_ relative to _Principles_ 6 and 7, with a greater\\nfocus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_\\nrelationship with that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n(2) While existing, formal guidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 will remain\\nrelevant to _firms_ in considering their obligations under _Principle_ 12,\\n_firms_ should also take due account of the inherent limits of such\\nguidance in light of the factors in (1). See also _PRIN_ 2A.1.3G.\\n\\n\\n(3) To the extent that a _firm_ is not acting in accordance with existing\\nguidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 and the behaviour would amount to a\\nbreach of _Principle_ 6 or 7 in the event that they had continued to\\napply, the behaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n(4) Where a _firm_ is acting in accordance with guidance on _Principles_ 6\\nand 7 that should not be relied on alone in considering how to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12. _Firms_ also need to consider all their\\nobligations not only under the _Principles_, but under any other\\napplicable law, including other _FCA rules_ such as those expanding\\nupon _Principle_ 12 as set out in _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.18 G The effect of _PRIN_ 3.2.10R is that the application of _Principles_ 6 and 7 is\\nunchanged with respect to a _firm’s_ activities insofar as they are not subject\\nto _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n**2A.2** **Cross-cutting obligations**\\n\\n\\nAct in good faith\\n\\n\\n2A.2.1 R A _firm_ must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 15 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.2.2 R Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by honesty, fair\\nand open dealing and acting consistently with the reasonable expectations\\nof _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.2.3 G Examples of where a _firm_ is not acting in good faith would include:\\n\\n\\n(a) failing to take account of _retail customers’_ interests, for example in\\nthe way it designs a _product_ or presents information;\\n\\n\\n(b) seeking inappropriately to manipulate or exploit _retail customers_, for\\nexample by manipulating or exploiting their emotions or behavioural\\nbiases to mis-lead or create a demand for a _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(c) taking advantage of a _retail customer_ or their circumstances, for\\nexample any characteristics of vulnerability, in a manner which is\\nlikely to cause detriment;\\n\\n\\n(d) carrying out the same activity to a higher standard or more quickly\\nwhen it benefits the _firm_ than when it benefits the _retail customer_,\\nwithout objective justification.\\n\\n\\n2A.2.4 G Acting in good faith does not mean a _firm_ is prevented from pursuing\\nlegitimate commercial interests or seeking a profit, provided it does so in a\\nmanner which is compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ . Long-term products\\nwhere the outcome is not easy to predict, or non-standard\\ncharging structures, or other features which may not be easy\\nfor _retail customers_ to understand may require greater care\\nfrom a _firm_ to promote, monitor and support consumer\\nunderstanding;\\n\\n\\n(c) the costs, fees and charges involved with the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the relative utility to _retail customers_ of the _product_ as a\\nwhole and of specific features, options, or services within the\\n_product_, if subject to separate fees or charges;\\n\\n\\n(2) the characteristics of the _retail customer_ or _retail customers_\\nincluding (to the extent that a _firm_ either knows about or should\\nreasonably have known about them), in particular:\\n\\n\\n(a) their reasonable expectations in relation to the _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) their resources, degree of financial capability or\\nsophistication, characteristics of vulnerability and corporate\\nstructure (where relevant).\\n\\n\\n(3) the _firm’s_ role in relation to the _product_, including:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ . Acting\\nreasonably does not require a _firm_ to assume a fiduciary duty\\nor require an advisory service where it does not already exist;\\n\\n\\nPage 42 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(b) whether the _firm_ has provided or will provide advice to the\\n_retail customer_ . What is reasonable may be different where\\nadvice is being provided;\\n\\n\\n(c) the _firm’s_ role in the _product’s_ distribution chain, in particular\\nits role in determining or materially influencing outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ in relation to the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the stage in the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ .\\nThere will be times when _retail customers_ are particularly\\nexposed to harm, for example when they fall into arrears or\\nare considering long-term investment decisions. The actions a\\n_firm_ needs to take to be acting reasonably in such\\ncircumstances may be greater than when a _retail customer_ is\\nmaking decisions which carry a lesser risk of adverse\\n\\noutcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.7.3 G Acting in a way that could reasonably be expected of a prudent _firm_\\nrequires more than adopting a single solution that is reasonable. It includes\\n(among other things) considering whether the preferred solution provides\\ngood outcomes for all _retail customers_ affected or only some; and if only\\nsome, why it does not work for all, and how best to identify additional\\nactions which might mitigate the outcome for those adversely affected.\\n\\n\\nProtected characteristics and characteristics of vulnerability\\n\\n\\n2A.7.4 G In relation to the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_, a _firm_\\nshould, among other things:\\n\\n\\n(1) pay appropriate regard to the nature and scale of characteristics of\\nvulnerability that exist in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) pay appropriate regard to the impact of characteristics of vulnerability\\non the needs of _retail customers_ in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) when dealing with a particular _retail customer_ pay appropriate regard\\nto the needs and characteristics of that _retail customer_, such as\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability;\\n\\n\\n(4) assist frontline staff to understand how to actively identify\\ninformation that could indicate vulnerability and, where relevant,\\nseek information from _retail customers_ with characteristics of\\nvulnerability that will allow staff to respond to their needs; and\\n\\n\\n(5) set up systems and processes in a way that supports and enables _retail_\\n_customers_ with characteristics of vulnerability to disclose their needs.\\n\\n\\nPage 43 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.7.5 G (1) _Firms_ should be aware that groups of _retail customers_ with specific\\nprotected characteristics may have, or be more likely to have,\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability, for example older customers. In\\naddition, where health is a driver of vulnerability it will likely have\\nsubstantial overlap with the protected characteristic of ‘disability’\\nunder the Equality Act 2010. _Firms_ should be mindful of this when\\nconsidering whether they are compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_\\n2A and their obligations under the Equality Act 2010 or equivalent\\nlegislation.\\n\\n\\n(2) _Firms_ should keep themselves appraised of any evidence that may\\nemerge that _retail customers_ with specific protected characteristics\\nare more likely to have characteristics of vulnerability. _Firms_ should\\ntake account of any such evidence when considering whether they are\\ncompliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A and their obligations under\\nthe Equality Act 2010 or equivalent legislation.\\n\\n\\n**2A.8** **Governance and culture**\\n\\n\\nGovernance, strategy and policies\\n\\n\\n2A.8.1 R A _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that _Principle_ 12 and the obligations in this chapter are\\nreflected in their strategies, governance, leadership and people\\npolicies, including incentives at all levels; and\\n\\n\\n(2) ensure that _retail customer_ outcomes are a central focus of:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ risk control arrangements under _SYSC_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) the _firm’s_ internal audit function.\\n\\n\\nStaff incentives\\n\\n\\n2A.8.2 G A _firm_ should not use staff incentives, performance management or\\nremuneration structures in a way that conflicts with their obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A. _Firms_ should be aware that these structures are\\ncapable of causing harm to _retail customers_ and should design their\\nstructures in a way that is consistent with ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\nGoverning body report\\n\\n\\n2A.8.3 R A _firm_ must prepare a report for its governing body setting out the results\\nof its monitoring under _PRIN_ 2A.9 and any actions required as a result of\\nthe monitoring.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.4 R At least annually, the governing body of a _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\nPage 44 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(1) review and approve the _firm’s_ report on the outcomes being received\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) confirm whether it is satisfied that the _firm_ is complying with its\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A; and\\n\\n\\n(3) assess whether the _firm’s_ future business strategy is consistent with\\nits obligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.5 R When approving the _firm’s_ report under _PRIN_ 2A.8.4R(1), the governing\\nbody of the _firm_ must also agree:\\n\\n\\n(1) any action required to address any identified risk that _retail_\\n_customers_ may not receive good outcomes;\\n\\n\\n(2) any action required to address any identified instance where _retail_\\n_customers_ have not received good outcomes; and\\n\\n\\n(3) any amendments to the _firm’s_ business strategy to ensure that it\\nremains consistent with meeting the _firm’s_ obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n**2A.9** **Monitoring of consumer outcomes**\\n\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\n\\n2A.9.1 R This section sets out the general obligation on _firms_ to monitor under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A the outcomes that _retail customers_ are\\nexperiencing from their _products_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.2 G The purpose of the monitoring obligation is to enable _firms_ to identify\\nwhether there are any risks that they are not meeting the requirements of\\nthe cross-cutting obligations and the _retail customer_ outcomes, and\\nconsequently they are not acting to deliver good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.3 G The frequency of monitoring, and the nature of the information a _firm_ must\\ncollect to effectively monitor the outcomes received by _retail customers_\\ndepends on the type of _firm_ and its role in the distribution chain, the nature\\nof the _product_, and the _target market_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.4 G (1) The monitoring obligation applies proportionately to a _firm’s_ role in\\nthe distribution chain.

This is in particular the effect of paragraphs (2)(f)\\nand (2)(g) of the definition of _retail customer_ .\\n\\n\\nObligations: Introduction\\n\\n\\n2.4.5 R (1) _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R exhaust what is required by _Rule_\\n6.\\n\\n\\n(2) Any reference in the _Handbook_ to the obligations on a member of a\\n_firm’s conduct rules staff_ under _Rule_ 6 is a reference to the\\nrequirements imposed by _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R.\\n\\n\\nObligations: Rules\\n\\n\\n2.4.6 R (1) You must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by\\nhonesty, fair and open dealing and acting consistently with the\\nreasonable expectations of _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.7 R You must avoid causing foreseeable harm to _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.8 R You must enable and support _retail customers_ to pursue their financial\\nobjectives.\\n\\n\\nReasonable application of Individual Conduct Rule 6\\n\\n\\n2.4.9 R The obligations in _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the standard\\nthat could reasonably be expected of a prudent _person_ subject to _COCON_ (as\\nset out in _COCON_ 1 (Application)):\\n\\n\\n(1) carrying on the same activity in relation to the same _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\nPage 62 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(2) taking appropriate account of the needs and characteristics of _retail_\\n_customers_ based on the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_\\nin the relevant target market or of individual _retail customers_ as the\\ncontext requires.\\n\\n\\nReferences to Principle 12\\n\\n\\n2.4.10 R Any reference in _COCON_ to _Principle_ 12 must be read in accordance with\\n_PRIN_ 2A.1.1R and _PRIN_ 2A.1.2R (Application) and _PRIN_ 2A.2.26R\\n(Interaction between Principle 12 and cross-cutting obligations).\\n\\n\\nAmend the following as shown.\\n\\n\\n**4** **Specific guidance on** ~~**individual**~~ **conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n**4.1** **Specific guidance on individual conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.1.18 G …\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relevance of\\nrules and guidance in PRIN\\n\\n\\n4.1.19 G The _guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2 (Cross-cutting obligations) will also be helpful\\nin interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.20 G (1) The _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2, insofar as not mirrored in _COCON_, will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus\\n_Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n(2) So for example, in line with _PRIN_ 2A.2.9R, in _COCON_ 2.4.7R:\\n\\n\\n(a) foreseeable harm may be caused by both act and omission;\\n\\n\\n(b) if the relationship of the _firm_ for which the relevant member\\nof its _conduct rules staff_ works with a _retail customer_ is\\nthrough its role in a distribution chain, foreseeable harm may\\nbe caused even where another _firm_ in that chain also\\ncontributes to the harm; and\\n\\n\\n(c) foreseeable harm may be caused even where another _person_\\nworking for the _firm_ is also responsible for or contributes to\\nthe harm.\\n\\n\\n4.1.21 G The outcomes _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.3 to _PRIN_ 2A.6 are also useful in defining\\nwhat is required by _Rule_ 6. However, the outcomes _rules_ do not exhaust\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.2 and so those _rules_ are not a comprehensive\\nguide to _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\nPage 63 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.22 G A reasonableness requirement applies to _Rule_ 6 (see _COCON_ 2.4.9R). The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility. This is particularly the case for _SMF_\\n_managers_ who are members of their _firm’s governing body_ or other senior\\n\\n_’_\\nmanagement forums and for other members of a _firm_ _s governing body_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.34 G On the other hand, the scope of the job of a junior staff member carrying out\\na back office function may not give much of an opportunity to take steps to\\nensure good outcomes for a _retail customer_ on the sale of a _product_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.35 G A salesperson or a member of the customer support staff is likely to have a\\nsignificant influence on the outcomes that a _retail customer_ receives. This is\\nthe case even if they are junior or subject to a detailed set of procedures.\\n\\n\\n**4.2** **Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nSC4: You must disclose appropriately any information of which the FCA or PRA\\nwould reasonably expect notice\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.2.30 G …\\n\\n\\n4.2.31 G The fact that the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_ works is under an\\nobligation to report something to the _FCA_ is relevant to the _SMF manager’s_\\nduties under SC4. So for example if the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_\\nworks is obliged by _PRIN_ 2A.9.17R to notify the _FCA_ that another _firm_ is not\\nor may not be complying with _Principle_ 12 or _PRIN_ 2A, the _SMF manager_\\nshould:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that the _firm_ reports that to the _FCA_ (or do so themselves) if\\nthe matter is within the scope of the _SMF manager’s_ responsibilities;\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\n(2) check whether the _firm_ has notified the matter if the matter is outside\\nthe responsibilities of the _SMF manager_ but the _SMF manager_ is\\nunable to assume that the _firm_ has notified it.\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 66 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex D**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the General Provisions (GEN)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text.\\n\\n\\n**2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**2.2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nGuidance applying while a firm has temporary permission\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n2.2.35A G A _TP firm_ should refer to the provisions listed below, which identify the _rules_\\nand _guidance_ in their sourcebooks that came into force after _IP completion day_\\nand in respect of which special provision has been made to apply them to _TP_\\n_firms_ .\\n\\n\\n_PRIN_ 3.1.13R,\\n\\n\\n_COBS_ 1.1.1CR,\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 67 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex E**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the Product Intervention and Product Governance sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text and striking through indicates deleted text.\\n\\n\\n**1** **Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**1.3** **Application of PROD 3**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nOther firms manufacturing or distributing financial instruments or structured\\ndeposits\\n\\n\\n1.3.2 R (1) Subject to (2) ~~Other~~ other _firms_ which _manufacture_ or _distribute_\\n_financial instruments_ or _structured deposits_ should take account of\\n_PROD_ 3 as if it were _guidance_ on the _Principles_ and other relevant _rules_\\nand as if “should” appeared in _PROD_ 3 rules instead of “must”.\\n\\n\\n(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a _firm_ to the extent that it is required to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12 (Consumer Duty) and _PRIN_ 2A in relation to\\na _product_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 68 of 68\\n\\n\\nPub ref: 007833\\n\\n\\n© Financial Conduct Authority 2022\\n12 Endeavour Square London E20 1JN\\nTelephone: +44 (0)20 7066 1000\\nWebsite: www.fca.org.uk\\nAll rights reserved</chunk>\")], [Document(metadata={'country': 'UK', 'source': 'FCA Consumer Duty Final Rules', '_id': '67c7d10a-60c9-41bd-94e4-85aa00281edb', '_collection_name': 'insurance-policies'}, page_content=\"<chunk_context>Annex 1 provides a comprehensive list of non-confidential respondents to the Consultation Paper CP21/36 regarding the new Consumer Duty proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ .

The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility.

In particular, it does not create a fiduciary\\nrelationship where one would not otherwise exist nor require a _firm_ to\\nprovide advice or carry out any other _regulated activity_ where it would not\\notherwise have done so.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.12 G The _FCA_ has issued guidance on the Consumer Duty in FG22/5, which\\n_firms_ should read alongside _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A as a guide to the\\n_FCA’s_ view as to how _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A might be complied with.\\n\\n\\nGuidance on responsibilities of firms in a product’s distribution chain\\n\\n\\n2A.1.13 G (1) _Principle_ 12 imposes obligations on _firms_ towards _retail customers_ of\\n_products_ irrespective of whether the customer is a _client_ of the _firm_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) This extended application aims to ensure the effectiveness of\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 which may properly relate to activities\\nwhich determine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes\\ncarried out by a _firm_ with whom the _retail customer_ is not in a _client_\\nrelationship.\\n\\n\\n(3) A _firm’s_ role in the distribution chain may mean it is unable to\\ndetermine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes in\\nconnection with the _product_ . If so, the _firm_ may not be subject to any\\nobligation under _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.14 G Obligations on _firms_ in the distribution chain of a _product_ must be\\ninterpreted reasonably, in a manner that reflects the _firm’s_ role in that\\n\\n\\nPage 14 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\ndistribution chain and the degree to which it can determine or materially\\ninfluence _retail customer_ outcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.15 G The extent of a _firm’s_ responsibilities under _Principle_ 12 in any one case\\nwill turn on the substance of the _firm’s_ role in the arrangements relating to\\nthe _product_ . A _firm_ which determines or has a material influence over _retail_\\n_customer_ outcomes is accountable notwithstanding that the _retail customer_\\nmay not be its _client_ due to the indirect nature of their relationship.\\n\\n\\nRelevance of guidance about Principles 6 and 7\\n\\n\\n2A.1.16 G Given the high-level nature and breadth of application of the _Principles_,\\nguidance about a _Principle_ cannot exhaustively cover its implications (see\\nalso _PRIN_ 1.1.9G).\\n\\n\\n2A.1.17 G (1) In general terms, _Principle_ 12 imposes a higher and more exacting\\nstandard of conduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_\\nrelative to what _Principles_ 6 or 7 would have otherwise required.\\n_Principle_ 12 also has a broader application in relation to a _firm’s_\\n_retail market business_ relative to _Principles_ 6 and 7, with a greater\\nfocus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_\\nrelationship with that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n(2) While existing, formal guidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 will remain\\nrelevant to _firms_ in considering their obligations under _Principle_ 12,\\n_firms_ should also take due account of the inherent limits of such\\nguidance in light of the factors in (1). See also _PRIN_ 2A.1.3G.\\n\\n\\n(3) To the extent that a _firm_ is not acting in accordance with existing\\nguidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 and the behaviour would amount to a\\nbreach of _Principle_ 6 or 7 in the event that they had continued to\\napply, the behaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n(4) Where a _firm_ is acting in accordance with guidance on _Principles_ 6\\nand 7 that should not be relied on alone in considering how to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12. _Firms_ also need to consider all their\\nobligations not only under the _Principles_, but under any other\\napplicable law, including other _FCA rules_ such as those expanding\\nupon _Principle_ 12 as set out in _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.18 G The effect of _PRIN_ 3.2.10R is that the application of _Principles_ 6 and 7 is\\nunchanged with respect to a _firm’s_ activities insofar as they are not subject\\nto _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n**2A.2** **Cross-cutting obligations**\\n\\n\\nAct in good faith\\n\\n\\n2A.2.1 R A _firm_ must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 15 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.2.2 R Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by honesty, fair\\nand open dealing and acting consistently with the reasonable expectations\\nof _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.2.3 G Examples of where a _firm_ is not acting in good faith would include:\\n\\n\\n(a) failing to take account of _retail customers’_ interests, for example in\\nthe way it designs a _product_ or presents information;\\n\\n\\n(b) seeking inappropriately to manipulate or exploit _retail customers_, for\\nexample by manipulating or exploiting their emotions or behavioural\\nbiases to mis-lead or create a demand for a _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(c) taking advantage of a _retail customer_ or their circumstances, for\\nexample any characteristics of vulnerability, in a manner which is\\nlikely to cause detriment;\\n\\n\\n(d) carrying out the same activity to a higher standard or more quickly\\nwhen it benefits the _firm_ than when it benefits the _retail customer_,\\nwithout objective justification.\\n\\n\\n2A.2.4 G Acting in good faith does not mean a _firm_ is prevented from pursuing\\nlegitimate commercial interests or seeking a profit, provided it does so in a\\nmanner which is compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ . Long-term products\\nwhere the outcome is not easy to predict, or non-standard\\ncharging structures, or other features which may not be easy\\nfor _retail customers_ to understand may require greater care\\nfrom a _firm_ to promote, monitor and support consumer\\nunderstanding;\\n\\n\\n(c) the costs, fees and charges involved with the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the relative utility to _retail customers_ of the _product_ as a\\nwhole and of specific features, options, or services within the\\n_product_, if subject to separate fees or charges;\\n\\n\\n(2) the characteristics of the _retail customer_ or _retail customers_\\nincluding (to the extent that a _firm_ either knows about or should\\nreasonably have known about them), in particular:\\n\\n\\n(a) their reasonable expectations in relation to the _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) their resources, degree of financial capability or\\nsophistication, characteristics of vulnerability and corporate\\nstructure (where relevant).\\n\\n\\n(3) the _firm’s_ role in relation to the _product_, including:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ . Acting\\nreasonably does not require a _firm_ to assume a fiduciary duty\\nor require an advisory service where it does not already exist;\\n\\n\\nPage 42 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(b) whether the _firm_ has provided or will provide advice to the\\n_retail customer_ . What is reasonable may be different where\\nadvice is being provided;\\n\\n\\n(c) the _firm’s_ role in the _product’s_ distribution chain, in particular\\nits role in determining or materially influencing outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ in relation to the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the stage in the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ .\\nThere will be times when _retail customers_ are particularly\\nexposed to harm, for example when they fall into arrears or\\nare considering long-term investment decisions. The actions a\\n_firm_ needs to take to be acting reasonably in such\\ncircumstances may be greater than when a _retail customer_ is\\nmaking decisions which carry a lesser risk of adverse\\n\\noutcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.7.3 G Acting in a way that could reasonably be expected of a prudent _firm_\\nrequires more than adopting a single solution that is reasonable. It includes\\n(among other things) considering whether the preferred solution provides\\ngood outcomes for all _retail customers_ affected or only some; and if only\\nsome, why it does not work for all, and how best to identify additional\\nactions which might mitigate the outcome for those adversely affected.\\n\\n\\nProtected characteristics and characteristics of vulnerability\\n\\n\\n2A.7.4 G In relation to the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_, a _firm_\\nshould, among other things:\\n\\n\\n(1) pay appropriate regard to the nature and scale of characteristics of\\nvulnerability that exist in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) pay appropriate regard to the impact of characteristics of vulnerability\\non the needs of _retail customers_ in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) when dealing with a particular _retail customer_ pay appropriate regard\\nto the needs and characteristics of that _retail customer_, such as\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability;\\n\\n\\n(4) assist frontline staff to understand how to actively identify\\ninformation that could indicate vulnerability and, where relevant,\\nseek information from _retail customers_ with characteristics of\\nvulnerability that will allow staff to respond to their needs; and\\n\\n\\n(5) set up systems and processes in a way that supports and enables _retail_\\n_customers_ with characteristics of vulnerability to disclose their needs.\\n\\n\\nPage 43 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.7.5 G (1) _Firms_ should be aware that groups of _retail customers_ with specific\\nprotected characteristics may have, or be more likely to have,\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability, for example older customers. In\\naddition, where health is a driver of vulnerability it will likely have\\nsubstantial overlap with the protected characteristic of ‘disability’\\nunder the Equality Act 2010. _Firms_ should be mindful of this when\\nconsidering whether they are compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_\\n2A and their obligations under the Equality Act 2010 or equivalent\\nlegislation.\\n\\n\\n(2) _Firms_ should keep themselves appraised of any evidence that may\\nemerge that _retail customers_ with specific protected characteristics\\nare more likely to have characteristics of vulnerability. _Firms_ should\\ntake account of any such evidence when considering whether they are\\ncompliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A and their obligations under\\nthe Equality Act 2010 or equivalent legislation.\\n\\n\\n**2A.8** **Governance and culture**\\n\\n\\nGovernance, strategy and policies\\n\\n\\n2A.8.1 R A _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that _Principle_ 12 and the obligations in this chapter are\\nreflected in their strategies, governance, leadership and people\\npolicies, including incentives at all levels; and\\n\\n\\n(2) ensure that _retail customer_ outcomes are a central focus of:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ risk control arrangements under _SYSC_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) the _firm’s_ internal audit function.\\n\\n\\nStaff incentives\\n\\n\\n2A.8.2 G A _firm_ should not use staff incentives, performance management or\\nremuneration structures in a way that conflicts with their obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A. _Firms_ should be aware that these structures are\\ncapable of causing harm to _retail customers_ and should design their\\nstructures in a way that is consistent with ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\nGoverning body report\\n\\n\\n2A.8.3 R A _firm_ must prepare a report for its governing body setting out the results\\nof its monitoring under _PRIN_ 2A.9 and any actions required as a result of\\nthe monitoring.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.4 R At least annually, the governing body of a _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\nPage 44 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(1) review and approve the _firm’s_ report on the outcomes being received\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) confirm whether it is satisfied that the _firm_ is complying with its\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A; and\\n\\n\\n(3) assess whether the _firm’s_ future business strategy is consistent with\\nits obligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.5 R When approving the _firm’s_ report under _PRIN_ 2A.8.4R(1), the governing\\nbody of the _firm_ must also agree:\\n\\n\\n(1) any action required to address any identified risk that _retail_\\n_customers_ may not receive good outcomes;\\n\\n\\n(2) any action required to address any identified instance where _retail_\\n_customers_ have not received good outcomes; and\\n\\n\\n(3) any amendments to the _firm’s_ business strategy to ensure that it\\nremains consistent with meeting the _firm’s_ obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n**2A.9** **Monitoring of consumer outcomes**\\n\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\n\\n2A.9.1 R This section sets out the general obligation on _firms_ to monitor under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A the outcomes that _retail customers_ are\\nexperiencing from their _products_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.2 G The purpose of the monitoring obligation is to enable _firms_ to identify\\nwhether there are any risks that they are not meeting the requirements of\\nthe cross-cutting obligations and the _retail customer_ outcomes, and\\nconsequently they are not acting to deliver good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.3 G The frequency of monitoring, and the nature of the information a _firm_ must\\ncollect to effectively monitor the outcomes received by _retail customers_\\ndepends on the type of _firm_ and its role in the distribution chain, the nature\\nof the _product_, and the _target market_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.4 G (1) The monitoring obligation applies proportionately to a _firm’s_ role in\\nthe distribution chain.

This is in particular the effect of paragraphs (2)(f)\\nand (2)(g) of the definition of _retail customer_ .\\n\\n\\nObligations: Introduction\\n\\n\\n2.4.5 R (1) _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R exhaust what is required by _Rule_\\n6.\\n\\n\\n(2) Any reference in the _Handbook_ to the obligations on a member of a\\n_firm’s conduct rules staff_ under _Rule_ 6 is a reference to the\\nrequirements imposed by _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R.\\n\\n\\nObligations: Rules\\n\\n\\n2.4.6 R (1) You must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by\\nhonesty, fair and open dealing and acting consistently with the\\nreasonable expectations of _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.7 R You must avoid causing foreseeable harm to _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.8 R You must enable and support _retail customers_ to pursue their financial\\nobjectives.\\n\\n\\nReasonable application of Individual Conduct Rule 6\\n\\n\\n2.4.9 R The obligations in _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the standard\\nthat could reasonably be expected of a prudent _person_ subject to _COCON_ (as\\nset out in _COCON_ 1 (Application)):\\n\\n\\n(1) carrying on the same activity in relation to the same _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\nPage 62 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(2) taking appropriate account of the needs and characteristics of _retail_\\n_customers_ based on the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_\\nin the relevant target market or of individual _retail customers_ as the\\ncontext requires.\\n\\n\\nReferences to Principle 12\\n\\n\\n2.4.10 R Any reference in _COCON_ to _Principle_ 12 must be read in accordance with\\n_PRIN_ 2A.1.1R and _PRIN_ 2A.1.2R (Application) and _PRIN_ 2A.2.26R\\n(Interaction between Principle 12 and cross-cutting obligations).\\n\\n\\nAmend the following as shown.\\n\\n\\n**4** **Specific guidance on** ~~**individual**~~ **conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n**4.1** **Specific guidance on individual conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.1.18 G …\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relevance of\\nrules and guidance in PRIN\\n\\n\\n4.1.19 G The _guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2 (Cross-cutting obligations) will also be helpful\\nin interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.20 G (1) The _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2, insofar as not mirrored in _COCON_, will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus\\n_Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n(2) So for example, in line with _PRIN_ 2A.2.9R, in _COCON_ 2.4.7R:\\n\\n\\n(a) foreseeable harm may be caused by both act and omission;\\n\\n\\n(b) if the relationship of the _firm_ for which the relevant member\\nof its _conduct rules staff_ works with a _retail customer_ is\\nthrough its role in a distribution chain, foreseeable harm may\\nbe caused even where another _firm_ in that chain also\\ncontributes to the harm; and\\n\\n\\n(c) foreseeable harm may be caused even where another _person_\\nworking for the _firm_ is also responsible for or contributes to\\nthe harm.\\n\\n\\n4.1.21 G The outcomes _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.3 to _PRIN_ 2A.6 are also useful in defining\\nwhat is required by _Rule_ 6. However, the outcomes _rules_ do not exhaust\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.2 and so those _rules_ are not a comprehensive\\nguide to _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\nPage 63 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.22 G A reasonableness requirement applies to _Rule_ 6 (see _COCON_ 2.4.9R). The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility. This is particularly the case for _SMF_\\n_managers_ who are members of their _firm’s governing body_ or other senior\\n\\n_’_\\nmanagement forums and for other members of a _firm_ _s governing body_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.34 G On the other hand, the scope of the job of a junior staff member carrying out\\na back office function may not give much of an opportunity to take steps to\\nensure good outcomes for a _retail customer_ on the sale of a _product_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.35 G A salesperson or a member of the customer support staff is likely to have a\\nsignificant influence on the outcomes that a _retail customer_ receives. This is\\nthe case even if they are junior or subject to a detailed set of procedures.\\n\\n\\n**4.2** **Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nSC4: You must disclose appropriately any information of which the FCA or PRA\\nwould reasonably expect notice\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.2.30 G …\\n\\n\\n4.2.31 G The fact that the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_ works is under an\\nobligation to report something to the _FCA_ is relevant to the _SMF manager’s_\\nduties under SC4. So for example if the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_\\nworks is obliged by _PRIN_ 2A.9.17R to notify the _FCA_ that another _firm_ is not\\nor may not be complying with _Principle_ 12 or _PRIN_ 2A, the _SMF manager_\\nshould:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that the _firm_ reports that to the _FCA_ (or do so themselves) if\\nthe matter is within the scope of the _SMF manager’s_ responsibilities;\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\n(2) check whether the _firm_ has notified the matter if the matter is outside\\nthe responsibilities of the _SMF manager_ but the _SMF manager_ is\\nunable to assume that the _firm_ has notified it.\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 66 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex D**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the General Provisions (GEN)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text.\\n\\n\\n**2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**2.2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nGuidance applying while a firm has temporary permission\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n2.2.35A G A _TP firm_ should refer to the provisions listed below, which identify the _rules_\\nand _guidance_ in their sourcebooks that came into force after _IP completion day_\\nand in respect of which special provision has been made to apply them to _TP_\\n_firms_ .\\n\\n\\n_PRIN_ 3.1.13R,\\n\\n\\n_COBS_ 1.1.1CR,\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 67 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex E**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the Product Intervention and Product Governance sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text and striking through indicates deleted text.\\n\\n\\n**1** **Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**1.3** **Application of PROD 3**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nOther firms manufacturing or distributing financial instruments or structured\\ndeposits\\n\\n\\n1.3.2 R (1) Subject to (2) ~~Other~~ other _firms_ which _manufacture_ or _distribute_\\n_financial instruments_ or _structured deposits_ should take account of\\n_PROD_ 3 as if it were _guidance_ on the _Principles_ and other relevant _rules_\\nand as if “should” appeared in _PROD_ 3 rules instead of “must”.\\n\\n\\n(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a _firm_ to the extent that it is required to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12 (Consumer Duty) and _PRIN_ 2A in relation to\\na _product_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 68 of 68\\n\\n\\nPub ref: 007833\\n\\n\\n© Financial Conduct Authority 2022\\n12 Endeavour Square London E20 1JN\\nTelephone: +44 (0)20 7066 1000\\nWebsite: www.fca.org.uk\\nAll rights reserved</chunk>\")], [Document(metadata={'country': 'UK', 'source': 'FCA Consumer Duty Final Rules', '_id': '67c7d10a-60c9-41bd-94e4-85aa00281edb', '_collection_name': 'insurance-policies'}, page_content=\"<chunk_context>Annex 1 provides a comprehensive list of non-confidential respondents to the Consultation Paper CP21/36 regarding the new Consumer Duty proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ .

The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility.

In particular, it does not create a fiduciary\\nrelationship where one would not otherwise exist nor require a _firm_ to\\nprovide advice or carry out any other _regulated activity_ where it would not\\notherwise have done so.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.12 G The _FCA_ has issued guidance on the Consumer Duty in FG22/5, which\\n_firms_ should read alongside _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A as a guide to the\\n_FCA’s_ view as to how _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A might be complied with.\\n\\n\\nGuidance on responsibilities of firms in a product’s distribution chain\\n\\n\\n2A.1.13 G (1) _Principle_ 12 imposes obligations on _firms_ towards _retail customers_ of\\n_products_ irrespective of whether the customer is a _client_ of the _firm_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) This extended application aims to ensure the effectiveness of\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 which may properly relate to activities\\nwhich determine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes\\ncarried out by a _firm_ with whom the _retail customer_ is not in a _client_\\nrelationship.\\n\\n\\n(3) A _firm’s_ role in the distribution chain may mean it is unable to\\ndetermine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes in\\nconnection with the _product_ . If so, the _firm_ may not be subject to any\\nobligation under _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.14 G Obligations on _firms_ in the distribution chain of a _product_ must be\\ninterpreted reasonably, in a manner that reflects the _firm’s_ role in that\\n\\n\\nPage 14 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\ndistribution chain and the degree to which it can determine or materially\\ninfluence _retail customer_ outcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.15 G The extent of a _firm’s_ responsibilities under _Principle_ 12 in any one case\\nwill turn on the substance of the _firm’s_ role in the arrangements relating to\\nthe _product_ . A _firm_ which determines or has a material influence over _retail_\\n_customer_ outcomes is accountable notwithstanding that the _retail customer_\\nmay not be its _client_ due to the indirect nature of their relationship.\\n\\n\\nRelevance of guidance about Principles 6 and 7\\n\\n\\n2A.1.16 G Given the high-level nature and breadth of application of the _Principles_,\\nguidance about a _Principle_ cannot exhaustively cover its implications (see\\nalso _PRIN_ 1.1.9G).\\n\\n\\n2A.1.17 G (1) In general terms, _Principle_ 12 imposes a higher and more exacting\\nstandard of conduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_\\nrelative to what _Principles_ 6 or 7 would have otherwise required.\\n_Principle_ 12 also has a broader application in relation to a _firm’s_\\n_retail market business_ relative to _Principles_ 6 and 7, with a greater\\nfocus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_\\nrelationship with that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n(2) While existing, formal guidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 will remain\\nrelevant to _firms_ in considering their obligations under _Principle_ 12,\\n_firms_ should also take due account of the inherent limits of such\\nguidance in light of the factors in (1). See also _PRIN_ 2A.1.3G.\\n\\n\\n(3) To the extent that a _firm_ is not acting in accordance with existing\\nguidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 and the behaviour would amount to a\\nbreach of _Principle_ 6 or 7 in the event that they had continued to\\napply, the behaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n(4) Where a _firm_ is acting in accordance with guidance on _Principles_ 6\\nand 7 that should not be relied on alone in considering how to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12. _Firms_ also need to consider all their\\nobligations not only under the _Principles_, but under any other\\napplicable law, including other _FCA rules_ such as those expanding\\nupon _Principle_ 12 as set out in _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.18 G The effect of _PRIN_ 3.2.10R is that the application of _Principles_ 6 and 7 is\\nunchanged with respect to a _firm’s_ activities insofar as they are not subject\\nto _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n**2A.2** **Cross-cutting obligations**\\n\\n\\nAct in good faith\\n\\n\\n2A.2.1 R A _firm_ must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 15 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.2.2 R Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by honesty, fair\\nand open dealing and acting consistently with the reasonable expectations\\nof _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.2.3 G Examples of where a _firm_ is not acting in good faith would include:\\n\\n\\n(a) failing to take account of _retail customers’_ interests, for example in\\nthe way it designs a _product_ or presents information;\\n\\n\\n(b) seeking inappropriately to manipulate or exploit _retail customers_, for\\nexample by manipulating or exploiting their emotions or behavioural\\nbiases to mis-lead or create a demand for a _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(c) taking advantage of a _retail customer_ or their circumstances, for\\nexample any characteristics of vulnerability, in a manner which is\\nlikely to cause detriment;\\n\\n\\n(d) carrying out the same activity to a higher standard or more quickly\\nwhen it benefits the _firm_ than when it benefits the _retail customer_,\\nwithout objective justification.\\n\\n\\n2A.2.4 G Acting in good faith does not mean a _firm_ is prevented from pursuing\\nlegitimate commercial interests or seeking a profit, provided it does so in a\\nmanner which is compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ . Long-term products\\nwhere the outcome is not easy to predict, or non-standard\\ncharging structures, or other features which may not be easy\\nfor _retail customers_ to understand may require greater care\\nfrom a _firm_ to promote, monitor and support consumer\\nunderstanding;\\n\\n\\n(c) the costs, fees and charges involved with the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the relative utility to _retail customers_ of the _product_ as a\\nwhole and of specific features, options, or services within the\\n_product_, if subject to separate fees or charges;\\n\\n\\n(2) the characteristics of the _retail customer_ or _retail customers_\\nincluding (to the extent that a _firm_ either knows about or should\\nreasonably have known about them), in particular:\\n\\n\\n(a) their reasonable expectations in relation to the _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) their resources, degree of financial capability or\\nsophistication, characteristics of vulnerability and corporate\\nstructure (where relevant).\\n\\n\\n(3) the _firm’s_ role in relation to the _product_, including:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ . Acting\\nreasonably does not require a _firm_ to assume a fiduciary duty\\nor require an advisory service where it does not already exist;\\n\\n\\nPage 42 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(b) whether the _firm_ has provided or will provide advice to the\\n_retail customer_ . What is reasonable may be different where\\nadvice is being provided;\\n\\n\\n(c) the _firm’s_ role in the _product’s_ distribution chain, in particular\\nits role in determining or materially influencing outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ in relation to the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the stage in the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ .\\nThere will be times when _retail customers_ are particularly\\nexposed to harm, for example when they fall into arrears or\\nare considering long-term investment decisions. The actions a\\n_firm_ needs to take to be acting reasonably in such\\ncircumstances may be greater than when a _retail customer_ is\\nmaking decisions which carry a lesser risk of adverse\\n\\noutcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.7.3 G Acting in a way that could reasonably be expected of a prudent _firm_\\nrequires more than adopting a single solution that is reasonable. It includes\\n(among other things) considering whether the preferred solution provides\\ngood outcomes for all _retail customers_ affected or only some; and if only\\nsome, why it does not work for all, and how best to identify additional\\nactions which might mitigate the outcome for those adversely affected.\\n\\n\\nProtected characteristics and characteristics of vulnerability\\n\\n\\n2A.7.4 G In relation to the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_, a _firm_\\nshould, among other things:\\n\\n\\n(1) pay appropriate regard to the nature and scale of characteristics of\\nvulnerability that exist in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) pay appropriate regard to the impact of characteristics of vulnerability\\non the needs of _retail customers_ in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) when dealing with a particular _retail customer_ pay appropriate regard\\nto the needs and characteristics of that _retail customer_, such as\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability;\\n\\n\\n(4) assist frontline staff to understand how to actively identify\\ninformation that could indicate vulnerability and, where relevant,\\nseek information from _retail customers_ with characteristics of\\nvulnerability that will allow staff to respond to their needs; and\\n\\n\\n(5) set up systems and processes in a way that supports and enables _retail_\\n_customers_ with characteristics of vulnerability to disclose their needs.\\n\\n\\nPage 43 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.7.5 G (1) _Firms_ should be aware that groups of _retail customers_ with specific\\nprotected characteristics may have, or be more likely to have,\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability, for example older customers. In\\naddition, where health is a driver of vulnerability it will likely have\\nsubstantial overlap with the protected characteristic of ‘disability’\\nunder the Equality Act 2010. _Firms_ should be mindful of this when\\nconsidering whether they are compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_\\n2A and their obligations under the Equality Act 2010 or equivalent\\nlegislation.\\n\\n\\n(2) _Firms_ should keep themselves appraised of any evidence that may\\nemerge that _retail customers_ with specific protected characteristics\\nare more likely to have characteristics of vulnerability. _Firms_ should\\ntake account of any such evidence when considering whether they are\\ncompliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A and their obligations under\\nthe Equality Act 2010 or equivalent legislation.\\n\\n\\n**2A.8** **Governance and culture**\\n\\n\\nGovernance, strategy and policies\\n\\n\\n2A.8.1 R A _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that _Principle_ 12 and the obligations in this chapter are\\nreflected in their strategies, governance, leadership and people\\npolicies, including incentives at all levels; and\\n\\n\\n(2) ensure that _retail customer_ outcomes are a central focus of:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ risk control arrangements under _SYSC_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) the _firm’s_ internal audit function.\\n\\n\\nStaff incentives\\n\\n\\n2A.8.2 G A _firm_ should not use staff incentives, performance management or\\nremuneration structures in a way that conflicts with their obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A. _Firms_ should be aware that these structures are\\ncapable of causing harm to _retail customers_ and should design their\\nstructures in a way that is consistent with ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\nGoverning body report\\n\\n\\n2A.8.3 R A _firm_ must prepare a report for its governing body setting out the results\\nof its monitoring under _PRIN_ 2A.9 and any actions required as a result of\\nthe monitoring.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.4 R At least annually, the governing body of a _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\nPage 44 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(1) review and approve the _firm’s_ report on the outcomes being received\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) confirm whether it is satisfied that the _firm_ is complying with its\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A; and\\n\\n\\n(3) assess whether the _firm’s_ future business strategy is consistent with\\nits obligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.5 R When approving the _firm’s_ report under _PRIN_ 2A.8.4R(1), the governing\\nbody of the _firm_ must also agree:\\n\\n\\n(1) any action required to address any identified risk that _retail_\\n_customers_ may not receive good outcomes;\\n\\n\\n(2) any action required to address any identified instance where _retail_\\n_customers_ have not received good outcomes; and\\n\\n\\n(3) any amendments to the _firm’s_ business strategy to ensure that it\\nremains consistent with meeting the _firm’s_ obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n**2A.9** **Monitoring of consumer outcomes**\\n\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\n\\n2A.9.1 R This section sets out the general obligation on _firms_ to monitor under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A the outcomes that _retail customers_ are\\nexperiencing from their _products_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.2 G The purpose of the monitoring obligation is to enable _firms_ to identify\\nwhether there are any risks that they are not meeting the requirements of\\nthe cross-cutting obligations and the _retail customer_ outcomes, and\\nconsequently they are not acting to deliver good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.3 G The frequency of monitoring, and the nature of the information a _firm_ must\\ncollect to effectively monitor the outcomes received by _retail customers_\\ndepends on the type of _firm_ and its role in the distribution chain, the nature\\nof the _product_, and the _target market_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.4 G (1) The monitoring obligation applies proportionately to a _firm’s_ role in\\nthe distribution chain.

This is in particular the effect of paragraphs (2)(f)\\nand (2)(g) of the definition of _retail customer_ .\\n\\n\\nObligations: Introduction\\n\\n\\n2.4.5 R (1) _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R exhaust what is required by _Rule_\\n6.\\n\\n\\n(2) Any reference in the _Handbook_ to the obligations on a member of a\\n_firm’s conduct rules staff_ under _Rule_ 6 is a reference to the\\nrequirements imposed by _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R.\\n\\n\\nObligations: Rules\\n\\n\\n2.4.6 R (1) You must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by\\nhonesty, fair and open dealing and acting consistently with the\\nreasonable expectations of _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.7 R You must avoid causing foreseeable harm to _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.8 R You must enable and support _retail customers_ to pursue their financial\\nobjectives.\\n\\n\\nReasonable application of Individual Conduct Rule 6\\n\\n\\n2.4.9 R The obligations in _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the standard\\nthat could reasonably be expected of a prudent _person_ subject to _COCON_ (as\\nset out in _COCON_ 1 (Application)):\\n\\n\\n(1) carrying on the same activity in relation to the same _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\nPage 62 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(2) taking appropriate account of the needs and characteristics of _retail_\\n_customers_ based on the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_\\nin the relevant target market or of individual _retail customers_ as the\\ncontext requires.\\n\\n\\nReferences to Principle 12\\n\\n\\n2.4.10 R Any reference in _COCON_ to _Principle_ 12 must be read in accordance with\\n_PRIN_ 2A.1.1R and _PRIN_ 2A.1.2R (Application) and _PRIN_ 2A.2.26R\\n(Interaction between Principle 12 and cross-cutting obligations).\\n\\n\\nAmend the following as shown.\\n\\n\\n**4** **Specific guidance on** ~~**individual**~~ **conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n**4.1** **Specific guidance on individual conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.1.18 G …\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relevance of\\nrules and guidance in PRIN\\n\\n\\n4.1.19 G The _guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2 (Cross-cutting obligations) will also be helpful\\nin interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.20 G (1) The _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2, insofar as not mirrored in _COCON_, will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus\\n_Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n(2) So for example, in line with _PRIN_ 2A.2.9R, in _COCON_ 2.4.7R:\\n\\n\\n(a) foreseeable harm may be caused by both act and omission;\\n\\n\\n(b) if the relationship of the _firm_ for which the relevant member\\nof its _conduct rules staff_ works with a _retail customer_ is\\nthrough its role in a distribution chain, foreseeable harm may\\nbe caused even where another _firm_ in that chain also\\ncontributes to the harm; and\\n\\n\\n(c) foreseeable harm may be caused even where another _person_\\nworking for the _firm_ is also responsible for or contributes to\\nthe harm.\\n\\n\\n4.1.21 G The outcomes _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.3 to _PRIN_ 2A.6 are also useful in defining\\nwhat is required by _Rule_ 6. However, the outcomes _rules_ do not exhaust\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.2 and so those _rules_ are not a comprehensive\\nguide to _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\nPage 63 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.22 G A reasonableness requirement applies to _Rule_ 6 (see _COCON_ 2.4.9R). The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility. This is particularly the case for _SMF_\\n_managers_ who are members of their _firm’s governing body_ or other senior\\n\\n_’_\\nmanagement forums and for other members of a _firm_ _s governing body_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.34 G On the other hand, the scope of the job of a junior staff member carrying out\\na back office function may not give much of an opportunity to take steps to\\nensure good outcomes for a _retail customer_ on the sale of a _product_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.35 G A salesperson or a member of the customer support staff is likely to have a\\nsignificant influence on the outcomes that a _retail customer_ receives. This is\\nthe case even if they are junior or subject to a detailed set of procedures.\\n\\n\\n**4.2** **Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nSC4: You must disclose appropriately any information of which the FCA or PRA\\nwould reasonably expect notice\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.2.30 G …\\n\\n\\n4.2.31 G The fact that the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_ works is under an\\nobligation to report something to the _FCA_ is relevant to the _SMF manager’s_\\nduties under SC4. So for example if the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_\\nworks is obliged by _PRIN_ 2A.9.17R to notify the _FCA_ that another _firm_ is not\\nor may not be complying with _Principle_ 12 or _PRIN_ 2A, the _SMF manager_\\nshould:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that the _firm_ reports that to the _FCA_ (or do so themselves) if\\nthe matter is within the scope of the _SMF manager’s_ responsibilities;\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\n(2) check whether the _firm_ has notified the matter if the matter is outside\\nthe responsibilities of the _SMF manager_ but the _SMF manager_ is\\nunable to assume that the _firm_ has notified it.\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 66 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex D**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the General Provisions (GEN)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text.\\n\\n\\n**2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**2.2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nGuidance applying while a firm has temporary permission\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n2.2.35A G A _TP firm_ should refer to the provisions listed below, which identify the _rules_\\nand _guidance_ in their sourcebooks that came into force after _IP completion day_\\nand in respect of which special provision has been made to apply them to _TP_\\n_firms_ .\\n\\n\\n_PRIN_ 3.1.13R,\\n\\n\\n_COBS_ 1.1.1CR,\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 67 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex E**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the Product Intervention and Product Governance sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text and striking through indicates deleted text.\\n\\n\\n**1** **Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**1.3** **Application of PROD 3**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nOther firms manufacturing or distributing financial instruments or structured\\ndeposits\\n\\n\\n1.3.2 R (1) Subject to (2) ~~Other~~ other _firms_ which _manufacture_ or _distribute_\\n_financial instruments_ or _structured deposits_ should take account of\\n_PROD_ 3 as if it were _guidance_ on the _Principles_ and other relevant _rules_\\nand as if “should” appeared in _PROD_ 3 rules instead of “must”.\\n\\n\\n(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a _firm_ to the extent that it is required to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12 (Consumer Duty) and _PRIN_ 2A in relation to\\na _product_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 68 of 68\\n\\n\\nPub ref: 007833\\n\\n\\n© Financial Conduct Authority 2022\\n12 Endeavour Square London E20 1JN\\nTelephone: +44 (0)20 7066 1000\\nWebsite: www.fca.org.uk\\nAll rights reserved</chunk>\")], [Document(metadata={'country': 'UK', 'source': 'FCA Consumer Duty Final Rules', '_id': '67c7d10a-60c9-41bd-94e4-85aa00281edb', '_collection_name': 'insurance-policies'}, page_content=\"<chunk_context>Annex 1 provides a comprehensive list of non-confidential respondents to the Consultation Paper CP21/36 regarding the new Consumer Duty proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ .

The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility.

In particular, it does not create a fiduciary\\nrelationship where one would not otherwise exist nor require a _firm_ to\\nprovide advice or carry out any other _regulated activity_ where it would not\\notherwise have done so.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.12 G The _FCA_ has issued guidance on the Consumer Duty in FG22/5, which\\n_firms_ should read alongside _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A as a guide to the\\n_FCA’s_ view as to how _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A might be complied with.\\n\\n\\nGuidance on responsibilities of firms in a product’s distribution chain\\n\\n\\n2A.1.13 G (1) _Principle_ 12 imposes obligations on _firms_ towards _retail customers_ of\\n_products_ irrespective of whether the customer is a _client_ of the _firm_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) This extended application aims to ensure the effectiveness of\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 which may properly relate to activities\\nwhich determine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes\\ncarried out by a _firm_ with whom the _retail customer_ is not in a _client_\\nrelationship.\\n\\n\\n(3) A _firm’s_ role in the distribution chain may mean it is unable to\\ndetermine or materially influence _retail customer_ outcomes in\\nconnection with the _product_ . If so, the _firm_ may not be subject to any\\nobligation under _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.14 G Obligations on _firms_ in the distribution chain of a _product_ must be\\ninterpreted reasonably, in a manner that reflects the _firm’s_ role in that\\n\\n\\nPage 14 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\ndistribution chain and the degree to which it can determine or materially\\ninfluence _retail customer_ outcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.15 G The extent of a _firm’s_ responsibilities under _Principle_ 12 in any one case\\nwill turn on the substance of the _firm’s_ role in the arrangements relating to\\nthe _product_ . A _firm_ which determines or has a material influence over _retail_\\n_customer_ outcomes is accountable notwithstanding that the _retail customer_\\nmay not be its _client_ due to the indirect nature of their relationship.\\n\\n\\nRelevance of guidance about Principles 6 and 7\\n\\n\\n2A.1.16 G Given the high-level nature and breadth of application of the _Principles_,\\nguidance about a _Principle_ cannot exhaustively cover its implications (see\\nalso _PRIN_ 1.1.9G).\\n\\n\\n2A.1.17 G (1) In general terms, _Principle_ 12 imposes a higher and more exacting\\nstandard of conduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_\\nrelative to what _Principles_ 6 or 7 would have otherwise required.\\n_Principle_ 12 also has a broader application in relation to a _firm’s_\\n_retail market business_ relative to _Principles_ 6 and 7, with a greater\\nfocus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_\\nrelationship with that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n(2) While existing, formal guidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 will remain\\nrelevant to _firms_ in considering their obligations under _Principle_ 12,\\n_firms_ should also take due account of the inherent limits of such\\nguidance in light of the factors in (1). See also _PRIN_ 2A.1.3G.\\n\\n\\n(3) To the extent that a _firm_ is not acting in accordance with existing\\nguidance on _Principles_ 6 and 7 and the behaviour would amount to a\\nbreach of _Principle_ 6 or 7 in the event that they had continued to\\napply, the behaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n(4) Where a _firm_ is acting in accordance with guidance on _Principles_ 6\\nand 7 that should not be relied on alone in considering how to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12. _Firms_ also need to consider all their\\nobligations not only under the _Principles_, but under any other\\napplicable law, including other _FCA rules_ such as those expanding\\nupon _Principle_ 12 as set out in _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.1.18 G The effect of _PRIN_ 3.2.10R is that the application of _Principles_ 6 and 7 is\\nunchanged with respect to a _firm’s_ activities insofar as they are not subject\\nto _Principle_ 12.\\n\\n\\n**2A.2** **Cross-cutting obligations**\\n\\n\\nAct in good faith\\n\\n\\n2A.2.1 R A _firm_ must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 15 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.2.2 R Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by honesty, fair\\nand open dealing and acting consistently with the reasonable expectations\\nof _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.2.3 G Examples of where a _firm_ is not acting in good faith would include:\\n\\n\\n(a) failing to take account of _retail customers’_ interests, for example in\\nthe way it designs a _product_ or presents information;\\n\\n\\n(b) seeking inappropriately to manipulate or exploit _retail customers_, for\\nexample by manipulating or exploiting their emotions or behavioural\\nbiases to mis-lead or create a demand for a _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(c) taking advantage of a _retail customer_ or their circumstances, for\\nexample any characteristics of vulnerability, in a manner which is\\nlikely to cause detriment;\\n\\n\\n(d) carrying out the same activity to a higher standard or more quickly\\nwhen it benefits the _firm_ than when it benefits the _retail customer_,\\nwithout objective justification.\\n\\n\\n2A.2.4 G Acting in good faith does not mean a _firm_ is prevented from pursuing\\nlegitimate commercial interests or seeking a profit, provided it does so in a\\nmanner which is compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ . Long-term products\\nwhere the outcome is not easy to predict, or non-standard\\ncharging structures, or other features which may not be easy\\nfor _retail customers_ to understand may require greater care\\nfrom a _firm_ to promote, monitor and support consumer\\nunderstanding;\\n\\n\\n(c) the costs, fees and charges involved with the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the relative utility to _retail customers_ of the _product_ as a\\nwhole and of specific features, options, or services within the\\n_product_, if subject to separate fees or charges;\\n\\n\\n(2) the characteristics of the _retail customer_ or _retail customers_\\nincluding (to the extent that a _firm_ either knows about or should\\nreasonably have known about them), in particular:\\n\\n\\n(a) their reasonable expectations in relation to the _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) their resources, degree of financial capability or\\nsophistication, characteristics of vulnerability and corporate\\nstructure (where relevant).\\n\\n\\n(3) the _firm’s_ role in relation to the _product_, including:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ . Acting\\nreasonably does not require a _firm_ to assume a fiduciary duty\\nor require an advisory service where it does not already exist;\\n\\n\\nPage 42 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(b) whether the _firm_ has provided or will provide advice to the\\n_retail customer_ . What is reasonable may be different where\\nadvice is being provided;\\n\\n\\n(c) the _firm’s_ role in the _product’s_ distribution chain, in particular\\nits role in determining or materially influencing outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ in relation to the _product_ ;\\n\\n\\n(d) the stage in the _firm’s_ relationship with the _retail customer_ .\\nThere will be times when _retail customers_ are particularly\\nexposed to harm, for example when they fall into arrears or\\nare considering long-term investment decisions. The actions a\\n_firm_ needs to take to be acting reasonably in such\\ncircumstances may be greater than when a _retail customer_ is\\nmaking decisions which carry a lesser risk of adverse\\n\\noutcomes.\\n\\n\\n2A.7.3 G Acting in a way that could reasonably be expected of a prudent _firm_\\nrequires more than adopting a single solution that is reasonable. It includes\\n(among other things) considering whether the preferred solution provides\\ngood outcomes for all _retail customers_ affected or only some; and if only\\nsome, why it does not work for all, and how best to identify additional\\nactions which might mitigate the outcome for those adversely affected.\\n\\n\\nProtected characteristics and characteristics of vulnerability\\n\\n\\n2A.7.4 G In relation to the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_, a _firm_\\nshould, among other things:\\n\\n\\n(1) pay appropriate regard to the nature and scale of characteristics of\\nvulnerability that exist in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) pay appropriate regard to the impact of characteristics of vulnerability\\non the needs of _retail customers_ in any relevant _target market_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) when dealing with a particular _retail customer_ pay appropriate regard\\nto the needs and characteristics of that _retail customer_, such as\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability;\\n\\n\\n(4) assist frontline staff to understand how to actively identify\\ninformation that could indicate vulnerability and, where relevant,\\nseek information from _retail customers_ with characteristics of\\nvulnerability that will allow staff to respond to their needs; and\\n\\n\\n(5) set up systems and processes in a way that supports and enables _retail_\\n_customers_ with characteristics of vulnerability to disclose their needs.\\n\\n\\nPage 43 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n2A.7.5 G (1) _Firms_ should be aware that groups of _retail customers_ with specific\\nprotected characteristics may have, or be more likely to have,\\ncharacteristics of vulnerability, for example older customers. In\\naddition, where health is a driver of vulnerability it will likely have\\nsubstantial overlap with the protected characteristic of ‘disability’\\nunder the Equality Act 2010. _Firms_ should be mindful of this when\\nconsidering whether they are compliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_\\n2A and their obligations under the Equality Act 2010 or equivalent\\nlegislation.\\n\\n\\n(2) _Firms_ should keep themselves appraised of any evidence that may\\nemerge that _retail customers_ with specific protected characteristics\\nare more likely to have characteristics of vulnerability. _Firms_ should\\ntake account of any such evidence when considering whether they are\\ncompliant with _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A and their obligations under\\nthe Equality Act 2010 or equivalent legislation.\\n\\n\\n**2A.8** **Governance and culture**\\n\\n\\nGovernance, strategy and policies\\n\\n\\n2A.8.1 R A _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that _Principle_ 12 and the obligations in this chapter are\\nreflected in their strategies, governance, leadership and people\\npolicies, including incentives at all levels; and\\n\\n\\n(2) ensure that _retail customer_ outcomes are a central focus of:\\n\\n\\n(a) the _firm’s_ risk control arrangements under _SYSC_ ; and\\n\\n\\n(b) the _firm’s_ internal audit function.\\n\\n\\nStaff incentives\\n\\n\\n2A.8.2 G A _firm_ should not use staff incentives, performance management or\\nremuneration structures in a way that conflicts with their obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A. _Firms_ should be aware that these structures are\\ncapable of causing harm to _retail customers_ and should design their\\nstructures in a way that is consistent with ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\nGoverning body report\\n\\n\\n2A.8.3 R A _firm_ must prepare a report for its governing body setting out the results\\nof its monitoring under _PRIN_ 2A.9 and any actions required as a result of\\nthe monitoring.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.4 R At least annually, the governing body of a _firm_ must:\\n\\n\\nPage 44 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(1) review and approve the _firm’s_ report on the outcomes being received\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) confirm whether it is satisfied that the _firm_ is complying with its\\nobligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A; and\\n\\n\\n(3) assess whether the _firm’s_ future business strategy is consistent with\\nits obligations under _Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n2A.8.5 R When approving the _firm’s_ report under _PRIN_ 2A.8.4R(1), the governing\\nbody of the _firm_ must also agree:\\n\\n\\n(1) any action required to address any identified risk that _retail_\\n_customers_ may not receive good outcomes;\\n\\n\\n(2) any action required to address any identified instance where _retail_\\n_customers_ have not received good outcomes; and\\n\\n\\n(3) any amendments to the _firm’s_ business strategy to ensure that it\\nremains consistent with meeting the _firm’s_ obligations under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.\\n\\n\\n**2A.9** **Monitoring of consumer outcomes**\\n\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\n\\n2A.9.1 R This section sets out the general obligation on _firms_ to monitor under\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A the outcomes that _retail customers_ are\\nexperiencing from their _products_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.2 G The purpose of the monitoring obligation is to enable _firms_ to identify\\nwhether there are any risks that they are not meeting the requirements of\\nthe cross-cutting obligations and the _retail customer_ outcomes, and\\nconsequently they are not acting to deliver good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.3 G The frequency of monitoring, and the nature of the information a _firm_ must\\ncollect to effectively monitor the outcomes received by _retail customers_\\ndepends on the type of _firm_ and its role in the distribution chain, the nature\\nof the _product_, and the _target market_ .\\n\\n\\n2A.9.4 G (1) The monitoring obligation applies proportionately to a _firm’s_ role in\\nthe distribution chain.

This is in particular the effect of paragraphs (2)(f)\\nand (2)(g) of the definition of _retail customer_ .\\n\\n\\nObligations: Introduction\\n\\n\\n2.4.5 R (1) _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R exhaust what is required by _Rule_\\n6.\\n\\n\\n(2) Any reference in the _Handbook_ to the obligations on a member of a\\n_firm’s conduct rules staff_ under _Rule_ 6 is a reference to the\\nrequirements imposed by _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R.\\n\\n\\nObligations: Rules\\n\\n\\n2.4.6 R (1) You must act in good faith towards _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n(2) Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by\\nhonesty, fair and open dealing and acting consistently with the\\nreasonable expectations of _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.7 R You must avoid causing foreseeable harm to _retail customers_ .\\n\\n\\n2.4.8 R You must enable and support _retail customers_ to pursue their financial\\nobjectives.\\n\\n\\nReasonable application of Individual Conduct Rule 6\\n\\n\\n2.4.9 R The obligations in _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the standard\\nthat could reasonably be expected of a prudent _person_ subject to _COCON_ (as\\nset out in _COCON_ 1 (Application)):\\n\\n\\n(1) carrying on the same activity in relation to the same _product_ ; and\\n\\n\\nPage 62 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n(2) taking appropriate account of the needs and characteristics of _retail_\\n_customers_ based on the needs and characteristics of _retail customers_\\nin the relevant target market or of individual _retail customers_ as the\\ncontext requires.\\n\\n\\nReferences to Principle 12\\n\\n\\n2.4.10 R Any reference in _COCON_ to _Principle_ 12 must be read in accordance with\\n_PRIN_ 2A.1.1R and _PRIN_ 2A.1.2R (Application) and _PRIN_ 2A.2.26R\\n(Interaction between Principle 12 and cross-cutting obligations).\\n\\n\\nAmend the following as shown.\\n\\n\\n**4** **Specific guidance on** ~~**individual**~~ **conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n**4.1** **Specific guidance on individual conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.1.18 G …\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relevance of\\nrules and guidance in PRIN\\n\\n\\n4.1.19 G The _guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2 (Cross-cutting obligations) will also be helpful\\nin interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.20 G (1) The _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.2, insofar as not mirrored in _COCON_, will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.6R to _COCON_ 2.4.8R and thus\\n_Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n(2) So for example, in line with _PRIN_ 2A.2.9R, in _COCON_ 2.4.7R:\\n\\n\\n(a) foreseeable harm may be caused by both act and omission;\\n\\n\\n(b) if the relationship of the _firm_ for which the relevant member\\nof its _conduct rules staff_ works with a _retail customer_ is\\nthrough its role in a distribution chain, foreseeable harm may\\nbe caused even where another _firm_ in that chain also\\ncontributes to the harm; and\\n\\n\\n(c) foreseeable harm may be caused even where another _person_\\nworking for the _firm_ is also responsible for or contributes to\\nthe harm.\\n\\n\\n4.1.21 G The outcomes _rules_ in _PRIN_ 2A.3 to _PRIN_ 2A.6 are also useful in defining\\nwhat is required by _Rule_ 6. However, the outcomes _rules_ do not exhaust\\n_Principle_ 12 and _PRIN_ 2A.2 and so those _rules_ are not a comprehensive\\nguide to _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\nPage 63 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.22 G A reasonableness requirement applies to _Rule_ 6 (see _COCON_ 2.4.9R). The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility. This is particularly the case for _SMF_\\n_managers_ who are members of their _firm’s governing body_ or other senior\\n\\n_’_\\nmanagement forums and for other members of a _firm_ _s governing body_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.34 G On the other hand, the scope of the job of a junior staff member carrying out\\na back office function may not give much of an opportunity to take steps to\\nensure good outcomes for a _retail customer_ on the sale of a _product_ .\\n\\n\\n4.1.35 G A salesperson or a member of the customer support staff is likely to have a\\nsignificant influence on the outcomes that a _retail customer_ receives. This is\\nthe case even if they are junior or subject to a detailed set of procedures.\\n\\n\\n**4.2** **Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nSC4: You must disclose appropriately any information of which the FCA or PRA\\nwould reasonably expect notice\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n4.2.30 G …\\n\\n\\n4.2.31 G The fact that the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_ works is under an\\nobligation to report something to the _FCA_ is relevant to the _SMF manager’s_\\nduties under SC4. So for example if the _firm_ for which an _SMF manager_\\nworks is obliged by _PRIN_ 2A.9.17R to notify the _FCA_ that another _firm_ is not\\nor may not be complying with _Principle_ 12 or _PRIN_ 2A, the _SMF manager_\\nshould:\\n\\n\\n(1) ensure that the _firm_ reports that to the _FCA_ (or do so themselves) if\\nthe matter is within the scope of the _SMF manager’s_ responsibilities;\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\n(2) check whether the _firm_ has notified the matter if the matter is outside\\nthe responsibilities of the _SMF manager_ but the _SMF manager_ is\\nunable to assume that the _firm_ has notified it.\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 66 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex D**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the General Provisions (GEN)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text.\\n\\n\\n**2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**2.2** **Interpreting the Handbook**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nGuidance applying while a firm has temporary permission\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n2.2.35A G A _TP firm_ should refer to the provisions listed below, which identify the _rules_\\nand _guidance_ in their sourcebooks that came into force after _IP completion day_\\nand in respect of which special provision has been made to apply them to _TP_\\n_firms_ .\\n\\n\\n_PRIN_ 3.1.13R,\\n\\n\\n_COBS_ 1.1.1CR,\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nPage 67 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n**Annex E**\\n\\n\\n**Amendments to the Product Intervention and Product Governance sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\nIn this Annex, underlining indicates new text and striking through indicates deleted text.\\n\\n\\n**1** **Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (PROD)**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\n**1.3** **Application of PROD 3**\\n\\n\\n…\\n\\n\\nOther firms manufacturing or distributing financial instruments or structured\\ndeposits\\n\\n\\n1.3.2 R (1) Subject to (2) ~~Other~~ other _firms_ which _manufacture_ or _distribute_\\n_financial instruments_ or _structured deposits_ should take account of\\n_PROD_ 3 as if it were _guidance_ on the _Principles_ and other relevant _rules_\\nand as if “should” appeared in _PROD_ 3 rules instead of “must”.\\n\\n\\n(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a _firm_ to the extent that it is required to\\ncomply with _Principle_ 12 (Consumer Duty) and _PRIN_ 2A in relation to\\na _product_ .\\n\\n\\nPage 68 of 68\\n\\n\\nPub ref: 007833\\n\\n\\n© Financial Conduct Authority 2022\\n12 Endeavour Square London E20 1JN\\nTelephone: +44 (0)20 7066 1000\\nWebsite: www.fca.org.uk\\nAll rights reserved</chunk>\")], [Document(metadata={'country': 'UK', 'source': 'FCA Consumer Duty Final Rules', '_id': '67c7d10a-60c9-41bd-94e4-85aa00281edb', '_collection_name': 'insurance-policies'}, page_content=\"<chunk_context>Annex 1 provides a comprehensive list of non-confidential respondents to the Consultation Paper CP21/36 regarding the new Consumer Duty proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

For example, if a _product_\\nis higher risk, _firms_ should take additional care to ensure it\\nmeets _retail customers’_ needs, characteristics and objectives\\nand is targeted appropriately;\\n\\n\\n(b) the _product’s_ relative complexity. _Retail customers_ may find\\nit more difficult to assess the features, suitability or value\\noffered by more complicated _products_ .

The\\n_guidance_ in _PRIN_ 2A.7 (General) on the corresponding _PRIN rule_ will also\\nbe helpful in interpreting _COCON_ 2.4.9R.\\n\\n\\n4.1.23 G _PRIN_ 2A applies to the whole of the _firm_ . Particularly for junior staff, this\\nmay mean that it sometimes imposes requirements or sets out expectations\\nthat are beyond the scope of the job of a member of a _firm’s conduct rules_\\n_staff_, thereby limiting its use as a guide to what is required under _Rule_ 6.\\nHowever, even when that is the case, it may still be useful as a guide to what\\na member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ should try to help their _firm_ achieve\\nwithin the scope of their job.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Relationship\\nwith Rule 4\\n\\n\\n4.1.24 G In general terms, _Rule_ 6 imposes a higher and more exacting standard of\\nconduct in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to what _Rule_ 4\\nin _COCON_ 2.1 (You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and\\ntreat them fairly) would have otherwise required. _Rule_ 6 also has a broader\\napplication in relation to a _firm’s_ _retail market business_ relative to _Rule_ 4,\\nwith a greater focus on consumer protection outcomes for _retail customers_,\\nincluding where those _retail customers_ do not stand in a _client_ relationship\\nwith that _firm_ in the distribution chain.\\n\\n\\n4.1.25 G While the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 will remain relevant to\\nsomeone in considering their obligations under _Rule_ 6, a _person_ should also\\ntake due account of the inherent limits of _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in light of the\\nfactors in _COCON_ 4.1.24G.\\n\\n\\n4.1.26 G To the extent that the _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4 in _COCON_ 2.1 says that behaviour\\nwould amount to a breach of _Rule_ 4 in the event that _Rule_ 4 had applied, that\\nbehaviour is likely to amount to a breach of _Rule_ 6.\\n\\n\\n4.1.27 G Where a _person_ is acting in accordance with _guidance_ on _Rule_ 4, that should\\nnot be relied on alone in considering how to comply with _Rule_ 6. A _person_\\nalso needs to consider all their obligations not only under _COCON_, but under\\nany other applicable law.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Scope\\n\\n\\n4.1.28 G _Rule_ 6 applies to all _conduct rules staff_, regardless of whether the _person_ has\\ndirect contact or dealings with _retail customers_ . _Persons_ subject to the _rules_\\nin _COCON_ should consider how their actions (or their failure to act) can\\naffect the interests of _retail customers_ or result in _retail customers_ not\\nobtaining a good outcome.\\n\\n\\nRule 6: You must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers: Reasonable\\napplication\\n\\n\\n4.1.29 G _COCON_ 2.4.9R says that _Rule_ 6 must be interpreted in accordance with the\\nstandard that could reasonably be expected of a prudent member of a _firm’s_\\n\\n\\nPage 64 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n_conduct rules staff_ . Factors relevant to this standard (in addition to the factors\\nreferred to in the material referred to in _COCON_ 4.1.22G) include:\\n\\n\\n(1) their seniority;\\n\\n\\n(2) the scope of their job and in particular the degree to which the\\nresponsibilities of the job are able to affect the outcomes experienced\\nby _retail customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(3) their level of expertise and experience;\\n\\n\\n(4) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ reasonably expects them\\nto have;\\n\\n\\n(5) the expertise and experience that their _firm_ should (under the\\n_regulatory system_ ) ensure they have; and\\n\\n\\n(6) the degree of discretion and judgment the _person_ has in their job,\\nincluding, for example, whether they are bound to a script or process\\nwhen dealing with _retail customers_ and how much discretion and\\njudgment any such script or process leaves to them.\\n\\n\\n4.1.30 G Someone in a management position is likely to have a greater ability to\\ninfluence the outcomes experienced by _retail customers_ than someone who is\\nnot. As described in _COCON_ 4.1.4G to _COCON_ 4.1.8G (Acting with due\\nskill, etc as a manager (rule 2)) and, in the case of an _SMF manager_, _COCON_\\n4.2 (Specific guidance on senior manager conduct rules), someone in a\\nmanagement position has a wide duty to understand, manage, control and\\noversee the business for which they are responsible. A manager should\\nperform those duties with a view to ensuring that _retail customers_ receive\\ngood outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.31 G The ability of a manager of a business area to achieve good outcomes for\\n_retail customers_ is likely to reflect the ability of their business area to do so.\\nSo for example the head of a business area dealing with _retail customers_ will\\nhave a correspondingly significant responsibility to ensure that those _retail_\\n_customers_ get good outcomes.\\n\\n\\n4.1.32 G Seniority may be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable for a member\\nof a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be expected to:\\n\\n\\n(1) analyse how their area of responsibilities fits into the overall systems\\nand processes of the _firm_ for ensuring good outcomes for _retail_\\n\\n_customers_ ;\\n\\n\\n(2) analyse the policies and procedures about _retail customers_ the _firm_\\nimposes on the _person_ and on the part of the business in which they\\nwork; and\\n\\n\\n(3) make suggestions for changes to those things.\\n\\n\\nPage 65 of 68\\n\\n\\n**FCA 2022/31**\\n\\n\\n4.1.33 G Seniority may also be relevant to the extent to which it is reasonable to\\nexpect a member of a _firm’s conduct rules staff_ to be concerned with policies\\nand procedures about _retail customers_ on a _firm_ -wide basis and not just for\\ntheir area of direct responsibility.
